/**
 * This class represents the prover preference page that
 * is contributed to the Preferences dialog. By 
 * subclassing <samp>FieldEditorPreferencePage</samp>, we
 * can use the field support built into JFace that allows
 * us to create a page that is small and knows how to 
 * save, restore and apply itself.
 * <p>
 * This page is used to modify preferences only. They
 * are stored in the preference store returned by
 * EditorUI.getPreferenceStore(). That way, preferences can
 * be accessed directly via the preference store.
 * 
 * We use the preference store from EditorUI.getPreferenceStore() because
 * that is where the preferences for annotation colors are stored by
 * eclipse, and we use marker annotations to show step status colors
 * in the editor.
 * 
 * There is some hackery involved in setting the color preference values.
 * For each logical color that appears on this preference page, there are
 * two marker types and thus two annotation types. One annotation type
 * corresponds to leaf steps and one to non-leaf steps. Each annotation type
 * has a key in the preference store that maps to that annotation's color.
 * Both annotation types for a given logical color should always be bound to the
 * same physical color. Thus, when the user changes the value of a logical
 * color, the two color preference keys for the two annotation types must both
 * map to the new physical color.
 * 
 * The original implementation used the same color preference key for both
 * annotation types. However, this does not seem to work. It appears that when
 * the physical color preference is changed for a given logical color, the editor
 * only recognizes the change to the color for one of the annotation types even though
 * the color has changed for both annotation types because they both have the same
 * color preference key.
 * 
 * The solution is the following. Use different color preference keys for two
 * annotation types corresponding to a given logical color. Only one of the keys
 * can be bound to the color field editor on the preference page. This page listens
 * for changes to the value of that key. When the value is changed, it sets the value
 * of its partner key to be the same. This is done in the method {@link #propertyChange(PropertyChangeEvent)}.
 * 
 * There is also a slight hack involved in laying out the field editors as we want them.
 * Check out {@link #adjustGridLayout()} to read more about this.  This hack works only
 * because there are no other preferences besides the 12 color-predicate ones.  If we
 * want to put other preferences on the page, the obvious thing to do is to put the
 * color-predicate preferences inside a Composite that is formatted appropriately.
 * Experimentation shows that this doesn't work in the obvious way.  Instead, each
 * field editor has to be put inside a separate composite inside the multi-column
 * composite.  The following code seems to work:
 *     protected void createFieldEditors()
 *    {
 *        Composite composite = new Composite(getFieldEditorParent(), SWT.NONE);
 *        GridLayout layout = new GridLayout();
 *        layout.numColumns = 4;
 *        layout.horizontalSpacing = 20;
 *        composite.setLayout(layout);
 *
 *        for (int i = 1; i <= NUM_STATUS_COLORS; i++)
 *        {
 *            Composite c = new Composite(composite, SWT.NONE);
 *            addField(new ColorFieldEditor(getMainColorPrefName(i), "Color "  + i + (i>9?"":"  "), c));
 *            c = new Composite(composite, SWT.NONE);
 *            addField(new ComboFieldEditor(getColorPredPrefName(i), "Predicate", ColorPredicate.PREDEFINED_MACROS, c));
 *            c = new Composite(composite, SWT.NONE);
 *            addField(new BooleanFieldEditor(getLeafSideBarPrefName(i), "Show Leaf Steps in Side Bar", c));
 *            c = new Composite(composite, SWT.NONE);
 *            addField(new BooleanFieldEditor(getAppliesToLeafPrefName(i), "Applies to Leaf Steps Only", c));
 *        }
 *    }
 *
 * However, the documentation warns that getFieldEditorParent() should be called 
 * separately for each field.  This doesn't seem to be necessary for a GRID layout,
 * but Dan & LL decided not to risk it and instead to put other preferences on a
 * separate page.
