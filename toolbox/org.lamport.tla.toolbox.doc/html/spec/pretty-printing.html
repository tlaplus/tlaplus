<h1>Pretty-Printing Modules</h1>

 <P>
You can create and view a pretty-printed
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/adobepdf.html"  target="_blank">PDF (Portable
Document Format)</a> version of a module.&nbsp;  Just view the module
in a module editor and select&nbsp; <samp>File/Produce PDF Version</samp>.&nbsp;  However,
to do this, you must have the&nbsp; <samp>pdflatex</samp>&nbsp; program installed.&nbsp;
This program is distributed with most versions of&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.latex-project.org/"  target="_blank"><samp>LaTeX</samp></a>&nbsp;
and&nbsp; <a href="http://www.tug.org/"  target="_blank"><samp>TeX</samp></a>.&nbsp;  A popular source
of TeX for PCs is&nbsp; <samp><a href="http://www.miktex.org/"  target="_blank">MiKTeX</a></samp>.
 </P>

<p>The Toolbox runs&nbsp; <samp>pdflatex</samp>&nbsp; to produce a PDF file with the
same name as the module, but with the extension&nbsp; <code>.pdf</code>.&nbsp;  It displays this
file in a separate page of the module editor, using your computer's default browser
to display the PDF file.&nbsp;  (If the browser doesn't have a plug-in that displays PDF files,
you can
<a href="http://get.adobe.com/reader/otherversions/"  target="_blank">find one on the web.</a>)&nbsp;

You can switch between the editable
ASCII version of the module and the PDF version by clicking on the appropriate
tab in the lower-left corner.&nbsp;

Changes made to the module are not automatically made to the PDF version.&nbsp;
To see them, you must create the PDF version again.
</p>

<!--
<p><font size=-1>
On Windows 7 and perhaps other operating systems, the PDF version is displayed outside
the Toolbox in a separate window.&nbsp;  That window must be closed before you can create
a new pretty-printed version.&nbsp; We have not yet figured out how to solve this problem.</font>
</p>
-->

<p>There are things you can do to help the pretty printer
produce better output.&nbsp;  They are described in the
<a href="help-print.html">Helping the Pretty-Printer</a>
help page.
</p>

<p>
A version of the program that does the pretty-printing can be used to add TLA+ and/or
PlusCal code to a LaTeX document.&nbsp;
See the section on the TLATeX Pretty-Printer on
<a href="https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/tools.html#tlatex?unhideBut=hide-tlatex&unhideDiv=tlatex">this page</a>
of the TLA+ Web site.

</p>

<h3>Preferences</h3>

<p>
The&nbsp; <samp>PDF Viewer Preferences</samp>&nbsp; page on
the&nbsp; <samp>File/Preferences</samp>&nbsp; menu provides the following options:

<h4>'Have your OS open PDFs' (macOS) or 'Use built-in PDF viewer' (Windows &amp; Linux)</h4>

By default, the PDF file is displayed using your system's default PDF viewer.&nbsp;

This option causes the Toolbox to instead either have the operating system open the PDF
using the user's default PDF viewing application (in macOS) or to use its own built-in viewer (in Windows and Linux.)&nbsp;

On some systems, the default viewer displays the PDF file in a
separate window that you must close before you can generate a new
version of the file.&nbsp;

If that is not what you want to happen, choose this option.&nbsp;

The built-in viewer does not yet provide a toolbar.&nbsp;

You can navigate with the <samp>Page Up</samp> and <samp>Page Down</samp> keys.&nbsp;

Use the <samp>+</samp> and <samp>-</samp> keys to zoom in and out.&nbsp;

The built-in viewer option is not offered on Mac OS X.

<h4>Regenerate pretty-printed PDF of spec save</h4>

When checked, the Toolbox automatically updates the pretty-printed version of the module every time
its corresponding editor is saved.
This is especially useful in presentations and trainings when the spec editor and PDF viewer
are arranged side by side to interactively build-up the spec but show attendees the pretty-printed version.

<h4>Shade comments</h4>
Comments are shaded in gray.&nbsp;  This is the default.&nbsp;  The darkness of the shading is specified
by the <b>Specify gray level</b> option.&nbsp;  This must be a number between
0.0 (completely black) and 1.0 (no shading).&nbsp;  The default is 0.85.

<p>

Note that comments within comments are not shown in the PDF view.&nbsp; The one exception is that
comments to PlusCal code are shown (even though they and the PlusCal code appear in a comment).

<h4>Do not shade PlusCal code</h4>
A PlusCal algorithm appears in a comment, so shading comments normally causes
PlusCal code to be shaded.&nbsp;  This option causes PlusCal code
not to be shaded.  (The code's comments are still shaded.)


<h4>Number lines</h4>

Number lines in the PDF output.&nbsp;  (This is independent of the line-numbering option for
the module editor.)&nbsp;  The default is unnumbered lines.

<h4>Specify dot command</h4>

This is the command with which the Toolbox calls&nbsp; <samp>dot</samp>&nbsp;
to produce state graph visualizations.&nbsp;  The default value&nbsp; <samp>dot</samp>&nbsp;
should work if the&nbsp; <samp>dot</samp>&nbsp; program is installed on your
computer.&nbsp;  However, if it is not properly installed, you may have to prefix it with the path name
of the program's directory.

<h4>Specify pdflatex command</h4>

This is the command with which the Toolbox calls&nbsp; <samp>pdflatex</samp>&nbsp;
to produce the pretty-printed version.&nbsp;  The default value&nbsp; <samp>pdflatex</samp>&nbsp;
should work if the&nbsp; <samp>pdflatex</samp>&nbsp; program is installed on your
computer.&nbsp;  However, if it is not properly installed, you may have to prefix it with the path name
of the program's directory.

<h4>Specify gray level</h4>

See the <b>Shade comments</b> option above.
