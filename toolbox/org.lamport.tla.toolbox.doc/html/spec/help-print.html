<h2><a name="intro"> Introduction</a></h2>
 <P> 
The toolbox pretty prints a module by calling the
TLATeX program.&nbsp;  TLATeX is a Java program for typesetting TLA+ specifications with&nbsp; 
<a href="http://www.latex-project.org/"><samp>LaTeX</samp></a>.&nbsp;
It was written by Leslie Lamport, based on ideas by Dmitri
Samborski.  
 </P>

<p>TLATeX's output should be good enough for most users.&nbsp;  Later sections
describe how you can get TLATeX to do a better job, and will explain
what happened in the unlikely case that it produces weird output.&nbsp;
However, if you happen to use any of the two-character 
sequences 
  <pre>
   `~   `^   `.
 </pre>
in a comment, you'd better read section <a href="#comments">How TLATeX Typesets Comments</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="spec"> How TLATeX Typesets the Specification</a></h2>

<p>
TLATeX should typeset the specification itself pretty much the way you
would want it to.&nbsp;  It preserves most of the meaningful alignments in
the specification.&nbsp;  For example, if the specification contains
<pre>  
  Action == /\ x'   = x - y
            /\ yy'  = 123
            /\ zzz' = zzz
</pre> <p> then the&nbsp; <code>/\</code>&nbsp; and&nbsp;
<code>=</code>&nbsp; symbols will be aligned in the output.&nbsp;  Extra
spaces in the input will be reflected in the output.&nbsp;  However, TLATeX
treats 0 and 1 space between symbols the same, so&nbsp;
<code>x+y</code>&nbsp; and&nbsp; <code>x&nbsp;+&nbsp;y</code>&nbsp;
produce the same output, but&nbsp;
<code>x&nbsp;&nbsp;+&nbsp;&nbsp;y</code>&nbsp; produces extra space
around the&nbsp; <code>+</code>&nbsp;.
</p>

<p>
TLATeX typesets the single TLA+ module that must appear in the input
file.&nbsp;  It will also typeset any material that precedes and follows the
module as if it were a comment.&nbsp;  However, that text won't be shaded.
</p>

<p>
TLATeX does not check that the specification is syntactically correct
TLA+ input.&nbsp;  However, it will report an error, which will be
reported to you by the Toolbox,  if the specification
contains an illegal lexeme, such as a semicolon (<code>;</code>). 
</p>


<h2><a name="comments"> How TLATeX Typesets Comments</a></h2>

 WARNING: A left single-quote&nbsp; <code>`</code>&nbsp; has special meaning to       
 TLATeX.&nbsp;  Enclosing a word in single-quotes like&nbsp; <code>`foo'</code>&nbsp; is      
 harmless, while&nbsp; <code>``</code>&nbsp; and&nbsp; <code>''</code>&nbsp; are 
just typeset as double-quotes.&nbsp;  
 But beware of an unmatched left-quote and of the following    
 two-character sequences:                                      
<pre>                                                               
    `~   `^   `.                                                 
</pre>                                                               
 See below for further details about what single-quotes and    
 these special sequences mean.&nbsp;                                 

<p>
TLATeX distinguishes between one-line and multi-line comments.&nbsp;  A
one-line comment is any comment that is not a multi-line comment.&nbsp;
Multi-line comments can be typed in any of the following three ways:
</p>

<pre>
  (*************************)
  (* This is the text of a *)
  (* multi-line comment.   *)
  (*************************)

  \********************
  \* This is the text 
  \* of the comment.  
  \********************

  (* This is the text
     of the comment.   *)
</pre>

<p> In the first two ways, the&nbsp; <code>(*</code>&nbsp; or&nbsp;
<code>\*</code>&nbsp; characters on the left must all be aligned, and
the last line of&nbsp; <code>*</code>&nbsp; characters is optional.&nbsp;
In the first way, nothing may appear to the right of the
comment--otherwise, the input is considered to be a sequence of
separate one-line comments.&nbsp;  In a multi-line comment, TLATeX usually
considers a sequence of non-blank lines to be a single paragraph, in
which case it will typeset them as one paragraph and ignore the line
breaks in the input.  </p>

<p>
TLATeX does its best to do a sensible job of typesetting comments.&nbsp;
You can help it by ending each sentence with a period (<code>.</code>) and by
adding blank lines to indicate logical separation of items.
</p>

<p>
There are three ways in which TLATeX can mess up the typesetting of
comments:
</p>

<ol>
 <li> Parts of a specification, such as identifiers and certain
    operators like&nbsp; <code>-</code>&nbsp;, should be typeset differently from ordinary
    text.&nbsp;  Identifiers should be italicized, and the minus in the
    expression&nbsp; <code>x-y</code>&nbsp; should be typeset differently from the dash 
    in &nbsp;<code>x-ray</code>.&nbsp; TLATeX gets this right most of the time, but it
    does make mistakes.
<p>
    You can tell TLATeX to treat something as part of a specification
    by putting single quotes&nbsp; <code>(`</code>&nbsp; and&nbsp; <code>')</code>&nbsp; 
    around it.&nbsp;  You can tell
    TLATeX to treat something as ordinary text by putting&nbsp; <code>`^</code>&nbsp; 
    and&nbsp; <code>^'</code>&nbsp; 
    around it--for example:
<pre>
       \***********************************
       \* To find the latest value of `bar',
       \* see `^http::/frob/bar^'.
       \***********************************
</pre>
    But, this is seldom necessary.&nbsp;  TLATeX usually does the right
    thing.
   <p>
    WARNING: Do not put any character between&nbsp; <code>`^</code>&nbsp; 
    and&nbsp; <code>^'</code>&nbsp; 
    except letters, numbers, and ordinary punctuation.&nbsp;  In 
    particular, do not put any of the following characters 
    between&nbsp; <code>`^</code>&nbsp; and&nbsp; <code>^'</code>:
<pre>                                                           
        _  ~  #  $  %  ^  &  <  >  \ "                     
</pre>                                                           
    See the section below on using LaTeX commands in comments    
    for further information about what can go 
    between&nbsp; <code>`^</code>&nbsp; and&nbsp; <code>^'</code>. 
 </li>

 <li> TLATeX does not do any fancy formatting of paragraphs.&nbsp;  For
    example, TLATeX will not precisely align the "A"s when typesetting:
<pre>
       \***********************
       \* gnat: A tiny insect.
       \*
       \* gnu:  A short word.
       \***********************
</pre>
    You can tell TLATeX to typeset a sequence of lines precisely the
    way they appear in the input, using a fixed-width font, by
    enclosing the lines with `.  and .' , as in:
<pre>
       \**********************************************
       \* The following picture explains everything:
       \*
       \*      `. -----------          --------
       \*        | Processor |------->| Memory |   
       \*         -----------          --------  .'
       \**********************************************
</pre>

    Using&nbsp; <code>`.</code>&nbsp; and&nbsp; <code>.'</code>&nbsp; 
    is the only reasonable thing to do for a
    diagram.&nbsp;  However, if you know (or want to learn) LaTeX, the
    section below on using LaTeX commands in comments will explain
    how you can get TLATeX to do a good job of formatting things like
    lists and tables.
</li>

<li> A paragraph may be typeset loosely, with one or more lines
    containing  &nbsp;&nbsp;  lots  &nbsp;&nbsp;     of  &nbsp;&nbsp; space  
     &nbsp;&nbsp;    between     
      &nbsp;&nbsp;  the    &nbsp;&nbsp;  words.&nbsp;
    This happens if there is no good way to typeset the paragraph.&nbsp;
    If this bothers you, the easiest solution is to rewrite the
    paragraph.&nbsp;  You can also try to fix the problem with LaTeX
    commands.&nbsp;  (See the section below on using LaTeX commands to
    format comments.)
</li> </ol> 

<p> 
TLATeX ignores any&nbsp; <code>(*</code>&nbsp; ...&nbsp; <code>*)</code>&nbsp; 
comment that appears within another comment.&nbsp;  So, you can get it not
to typeset part of a comment by enclosing that part between&nbsp; <code>(*</code>&nbsp; 
and&nbsp; <code>*)</code>&nbsp; 
But a better way to omit part of a comment is to enclose it between&nbsp; <code>`~</code>&nbsp; 
and&nbsp; <code>~'</code>. 
</p>

<h2><a name="latex">Using LaTeX Commands to Format Comments</a></h2>

TLATeX puts any text enclosed between&nbsp; <code>`^</code>&nbsp; 
and&nbsp; <code>^'</code>&nbsp; 
in a comment into the
LaTeX input file exactly as it appears.&nbsp;  This allows you to insert
LaTeX formating commands in comments.&nbsp;  There are two ways to use this.

<ol>
<li> You can enclose between `^ and ^' a short phrase appearing on
    a single line of input.&nbsp;  LaTeX typesets that phrase as part of
    the enclosing paragraph.
</li>
 
<li>
  You can enclose one or more complete lines of a multi-line
    comment between&nbsp; <code>`^</code>&nbsp; 
and&nbsp; <code>^'</code>&nbsp;.&nbsp; That text is typeset as one or
more separate paragraphs whose prevailing left margin is determined by
the position of the &nbsp; <code>`^</code>&nbsp;.&nbsp; For example,
the input
<pre>
       \**********************************
       \* The first comment paragraph.
       \*
       \*    The second comment
       \*    paragraph.
       \*
       \*    `^ Some LaTeX-formated 
       \*  text  ^'
       \**********************************
</pre>
    causes the LaTeX-formated text to be typeset in a separate
    paragraph whose prevailing left margin is the same as in the
    second comment paragraph.
</li>
</ol>
LaTeX typesets the text between&nbsp; <code>`^</code>&nbsp; 
and&nbsp; <code>^'</code>&nbsp; in LR mode for a one-line
comment and in paragraph mode for a multi-line comment.&nbsp;  The LaTeX
file produced by TLATeX defines a "describe" environment that is
useful for formating text in a multi-line&nbsp; 
<code>`^&nbsp;...&nbsp;^'</code>&nbsp;.&nbsp;  This
environment is the same as the standard LaTeX "description"
environment, except that it takes an argument, which should be the
widest item label in the environment.&nbsp;  For example, the input might
contain
<pre>
       \***********************
       \*    `^ \begin{describe}{gnat:}
       \*        \item[gnat:] A tiny insect.
       \*  
       \*        \item[gnu:]  A short word.
       \*       \end{describe} ^'
       \***********************
</pre>
<p>
<em>Warning:</em> An error in a LaTeX command inside &nbsp; 
<code>`^&nbsp;...&nbsp;^'</code>&nbsp; text
can  
cause TLATeX not to produce any output. 
</p>

<p>
TLATeX has a feature that is not relevant to use with the Toolbox
that involves putting code between&nbsp; <code>`~</code>&nbsp; 
and&nbsp; <code>~'</code>&nbsp;.&nbsp;   Unless you are also using
TLATeX outside the Toolbox and know what you're doing, do
not put &nbsp; <code>`~</code>&nbsp; 
or&nbsp; <code>~'</code>&nbsp; in comments.
