<h1>Creating a Model</h1>

<P>
When you open a model, you open it in a <em>model editor</em>.&nbsp;  The model editor then
shows only one page if the model has never been run before, and if it has been opened before,
no other pages were kept open: &mdash; the  <A href="overview-page.html"> Model Overview Page.</A>
<br/>
If the model has been run before, the <A href="results-page.html"> Model Checking Results Page</A> will
be opened showing what the checker did the last time it was
run.&nbsp; The Model Overview Page contains links that open three other pages,
the <A href="spec-options-page.html">Spec Options</A> page, the
<A href="tlc-options-page.html">TLC Options</A> page, and the Results / Constant Expressions page(s)
should you want to work with Constant Expressions having not yet run the model a first time.

You can switch between the pages using the tabs at the upper-left of the
model editor <a href="../gettingstarted/views.html">view</a>, or with the&nbsp;
<samp>Alt+PageUp</samp>&nbsp; and&nbsp;
<samp>Alt+PageDown</samp>&nbsp; keys.
 </P>

<p>You edit these pages in the usual way.&nbsp;  Sections can be opened or closed by clicking
the&nbsp;
<samp>+</samp>&nbsp; or&nbsp;
<samp>-</samp>&nbsp;.  When entering text in fields, you can use your system's
standard editing commands.
</p>


<p>Whenever you enter a TLA<sup>+</sup> expression as part of the model,
that expression can use any
symbols that you could use in a new definition placed at the end of the spec's root module.&nbsp;
It can also contain any <a href="model-values.html">model values</a> that are declared
in the model, as well as additional definitions entered in the
<a href="spec-options-page.html#additional">Additional Definitions</a> section
of the Spec Options page.
