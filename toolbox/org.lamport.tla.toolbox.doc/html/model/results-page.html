 <P> 
This page reports the history and status of the current or most recent execution of
TLC on this model.&nbsp;  This information is retained after TLC stops (either successfully or
with an error).&nbsp;  Even if you close
the spec and open another one, or if you close the Toolbox, it will be there the next time you
open the spec and this model.&nbsp;  The information is lost only if you run TLC on the model
 again or delete the model or the entire spec.&nbsp;  So, don't re-run TLC on this model
 until you are sure you're through examining the results of running it the last time.&nbsp;
 </p><p>Note that you can set the Toolbox to automatically snapshot (clone) the model
 when you re-run it. Please click the corresponding checkbox on the TLC Model Checker
 preference page on the File/Preferences menu. A model snapshot appears in the spec explorer
 tree as a child of its (parent) model. The snapshot's name indicates the date and time of its creation.
 Alternatively, you can manually create a clone of this model to run TLC on.&nbsp;  (See the
 <a href="about-models.html"><em>Models</em></a> help page.)
 </P>


<h2><a name="general">General</a></h2>

<p>
The information reported in this section is self-explanatory.&nbsp;  See the
<a href="overview-page.html#how-to-run">How to run</a> section of the 
<a href="overview-page.html"><em>Model Overview Page</em></a>  help page.&nbsp;  
Clicking on the <em>Errors detected</em> field's link raises the 
<a href="executing-tlc.html#error-reports">TLC Errors View</a>;
ignore the number of errors the field reports.
</p>

<h2><a name="statistics">Statistics</a></h2>

Two kinds of statistics are reported:
<h3>State space progress</h3>

<p>
This shows a history of TLC's reachable state space computation.&nbsp;  The columns have the
following meanings.&nbsp;  (See Section&nbsp;14.26 [page 237] of
<em><a href=
"http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/book.html" target="_blank">
Specifying Systems</a></em>.)  </p>
<dl>
<dt><b>Diameter</b></dt>
<dd>The diameter of the reachable-state graph.&nbsp;  It is the length of the longest behavior
found so far.</dd>

<dt><b>States Found</b></dt>
<dd>The total number of states TLC has examined so far.</dd>

<dt><b>Distinct States</b></dt>
<dd>The number of distinct states among the states found.</dd>

<dt><b>Queue Size</b></dt>
<dd>The number of (distinct) states found whose successor states TLC has not
yet determined.  
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Clicking on the heading of any column displays a graph of that column's value
(the vertical axis) versus execution time (the horizontal axis).</p>

<p>
The queue size is the best guide to how far along TLC is in its computation 
of the reachable states.&nbsp;  For most behavior specs, the graph of the queue size versus time
is a convex curve that grows to a maximum and then decreases. 
</p>

<h3>Sub-Actions of next-state</h3>
<p>
A common error in writing a behavior spec is for an action not to be enabled when
it should be, so the spec cannot reach states that represent reachable states of
the actual system being specified.&nbsp;  This kind of error leads to a violation of desired
liveness properties, but does not cause any violation of safety.&nbsp;  The action
statistics give you a way of catching such an error even if you're not
checking liveness.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>Sub-Actions of next-state shows the number of states generated by each sub-action of 
the next-state relation.  Don't worry about how TLC decides what a 
sub-action is; just look at the values reported and the corresponding 
parts of the specification to which they refer.  A sub-action that
generates no states - emphasized by yellow background coloring of the
table row - usually indicates an error in the spec.&nbsp; 
Double-clicking on an entry takes you to the indicated location.  The time shown 
above the table indicates the execution time the numbers were recorded.
</p>

<h2><a name="evaluate">Evaluate Constant Expression</a> </h2>
<p>
This section is described <a href="evaluate-constant-expression.html">on its own page.</a>
</p>

<h2><a name="user">User Output</a></h2>

<p>This section shows the output generated by TLC when it evaluates <code>Print</code>
and <code>PrintT</code> expressions in the spec.&nbsp;  (A PlusCal <code>print</code> statement
generates a TLA<sup>+</sup> <code>PrintT</code> expression.)&nbsp;  These expressions are most often used
for debugging.&nbsp;  The <code>Print</code> operator is described in Section&nbsp;14.4 (page&nbsp;248) of
<em><a href=
"http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/book.html" target="_blank">
Specifying Systems</a></em>;  <code>PrintT(exp)</code> is defined to equal <code>Print(exp,TRUE)</code>.
</p>

<h2><a name="progress">Progress Output</a></h2>

This section shows certain progress messages generated by 
TLC.&nbsp; All the useful information that it contains should be summarized in the <em>General</em>
section above.&nbsp;  However, it's possible that we've forgotten about something and that 
you will want to see this TLC output.&nbsp;  Check this section if something you
don't understand happens when the Toolbox
runs
TLC.&nbsp;  If you don't find anything that helps you here, try 
the <a href="executing-tlc.html#console">TLC Console View</a>.
