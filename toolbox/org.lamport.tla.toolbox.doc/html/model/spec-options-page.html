<P> 
This model editor page allows you to add less-often
used parts of a model that describe the spec
that the Toolbox calls TLC to check.&nbsp;  It's a good idea to browse
this page just to see what options it provides, since
some of the features are not ones you would expect.&nbsp;
The page is raised  from a link on the <a href="overview-page.html">Model Overview Page</a>.
 </P>

<h2><a name="additional">Additional Definitions</a></h2>

<p>
It is sometimes convenient to define operators just
for use in the expressions that specify a model.&nbsp;  For
example, you might want to define an operator that
you use can use in more than one invariant.&nbsp;  If you
don't want those definitions to be part of the spec,
you can put them in this section of the page.&nbsp;  These
definitions can use any operator or parameters that
can be used in the the root module, as well as any
<a href="model-values.html">model value</a> that is
declared in the model.
</p>

<p>
In addition to definitions, in this section you can also 
put assumptions (<code>ASSUME</code>&nbsp; statements)
for TLC to check.&nbsp;  Putting other
things in this section, such as declarations,
will result in mysterious TLC errors.

</p>
<h2><a name="state">State Constraint</a></h2>

<p>
Many behavior specifications have an infinite set of reachable 
states.&nbsp;  For example, message queues could get arbitrarily large.&nbsp;  
TLC will run forever (or until your computer runs out
of disk space) on such a behavior spec.&nbsp;  You could just let it
run and keep looking for violations of safety properties such as invariance.&nbsp;
However, it's a better idea to limit the set of states by entering
a state constraint here.
</p>

<p>
A state constraint is a state predicate, which is a
Boolean-valued expression that contains unprimed variables.&nbsp;
When computing the set of reachable states, TLC will not
explore successor states of any state it finds that does
<em>not</em> satisfy the state constraint.&nbsp;  For example,
specifying&nbsp; <code>len < 3</code>&nbsp; essentially
limits the set of reachable states that TLC finds to ones
that can be reached by a sequence of states in which 
the value of the variable&nbsp; <code>len</code>&nbsp; 
is less than 3.&nbsp;  See Section 14.3 (page 240) of 
<em><a href=
"http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/book.html" target="_blank">
Specifying Systems</a></em> for an explanation of how TLC
computes reachable states.&nbsp;  Note that there is no need
for multiple state constraints because they can simply be
conjoined to form a single constraint.
</p>

<!-- 
<p>A state constraint has an effect only in model checking mode.  (See
<a href="#launching">TLC Options</a>.)
</p>
 -->

<h2><a name="model">Model Values</a></h2>

You can enter here a set of model values, which you can then
use in expressions that define the model--for example, in
the value substituted for a declared constant.&nbsp;  See the
<A href="model-values.html"><em>Model Values and Symmetry</em></A> help
page for an explanation of what model values are and how they
are used.

<h2><a name="override">Definition Override</a></h2>
<p>
We want our specifications to be as simple and easy to understand as
possible.&nbsp;  Sometimes this leads to a definition that TLC cannot evaluate,
or that it can evaluate only very inefficiently.&nbsp;  In that case, we
must <em>override</em> the definition by telling TLC to replace it with
a new definition.&nbsp;   To do this, click on the section's&nbsp; <samp>Add</samp>&nbsp;
button, select the operator whose definition you want to override, and 
click&nbsp; <samp>OK</samp>&nbsp;.&nbsp;  (You can also double-click on the
operator name.)&nbsp;  This will raise a dialog in which you can specify
the overriding.
</p>

<p>
If the operator whose definition you are overriding has arguments,
you will be presented with a form for writing the new definition in
the obvious way.&nbsp;  If it has no arguments, you have two
options.&nbsp;  With the <em>Ordinary assignment</em> option, you just
write the new definition.&nbsp;  The <em>Model value</em> option
defines the operator to equal a model value of the same name.&nbsp;
See the
<A href="model-values.html"><em>Model Values and Symmetry</em></A> help
page for an explanation of model values and the most common
reason why you would want to override the definition in this way.
</p>

<p>
You can override definitions made in modules other than the root module.&nbsp;
If a definition is in a module imported with an&nbsp; <samp>INSTANCE</samp>&nbsp;
statement, then the name of the module containing the definition is indicated.
</p>

<p>
You can edit or remove an overriding specification in the obvious way: by selecting it and
using the&nbsp; <samp>Edit</samp>&nbsp; or&nbsp; <samp>Remove</samp>&nbsp; button.&nbsp;
(Editing is also selected by double-clicking on the item.)
</p>

<p fontsize=80%>
<b>Some Fine Print</b>&nbsp;
<font size=-1>
When overriding a definition, 
the new definition can use any operator or parameters that
can be used in the the root module, as well as any
<a href="model-values.html">model value</a> that is
declared in the model.&nbsp;  This means that you can override
a definition with an expression that
contains operators that are undefined at the point where the
original definition occurred.&nbsp;
TLC evaluates overridden definitions in the
obvious way, and bizarre overriding can
lead to strange results.&nbsp;  For example, if&nbsp; <samp>Fact</samp>&nbsp; is defined by
<pre>
   Fact(n)  ==  IF n = 0 THEN 1 ELSE n * Bar(n-1)
</pre>
and the definition of&nbsp; <samp>Bar</samp>&nbsp; is overridden with
<pre>
   Bar(n) <- Fact(n)
</pre>
then TLC will evaluate&nbsp; <samp>Fact(n)</samp>&nbsp; to 
equal&nbsp; <samp>n!</samp>&nbsp; for any natural 
number&nbsp; <samp>n</samp>&nbsp;.&nbsp;
There is no good reason to use such bizarre overriding.</font>

<h2><a name="action">Action Constraint</a></h2>

An action constraint is much like a <a href="#state">state constraint</a>, except 
that the constraint formula may also include primed variables.&nbsp;
See Section 14.3 (page 240) of 
<em><a href=
"http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/book.html" target="_blank">
Specifying Systems</a></em> for an explanation of how TLC uses an
action constraint.
