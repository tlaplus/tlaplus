 <P> 
This model editor page allows you to make the most common choices
of the parameter values with which TLC is to be run.&nbsp; 
It contains links to the <a href="spec-options-page.html">Spec Options Page</a>
for specifying additional 
options for telling TLC what spec behaviors to check and 
to the <a href="tlc-options-page.html">TLC Options Page</a> for specifying additional
ways to control the execution of TLC.&nbsp;
Here are what the different sections of the Model Overview
page are for. 
 </P>

<h2><a name="model-description">Model description</a></h2>

Enter any text you want here.&nbsp;  The first line of the text is
displayed in the <a href="about-models.html#quick-access">Quick Access</a> window's list of models.

<h2><a name="what-is-behavior">What is the behavior spec?</a></h2>

The behavior spec is the formula or pair of formulas that describe the
possible behaviors of the system or algorithm you want to check.&nbsp;  (See
the <a href="../spec/what-is.html"><em>What Is A Spec?</em></a> help page.)&nbsp;
There are two ways to write the behavior spec:
<dl>
<dt><b>Init and Next</b></dt>
<dd>A pair of formulas that specify the initial state and the next-state relation,
respectively.
</dd>
</dd>
<dt><b>Single formula</b></dt>
<dd>A single temporal formula of the form&nbsp; <code>Init /\ [][Next]<sub>vars</sub> /\ F</code>,&nbsp;
where&nbsp; <code>Init</code>&nbsp; is the initial predicate,&nbsp; 
  <code>Next</sub></code>&nbsp; is the next-state 
relation,&nbsp; <code>vars</code>&nbsp;
is the tuple of variables,
and&nbsp; <code>F</code>&nbsp; is an optional fairness formula.

</dd>
</dl>
The only way to write a behavior spec that includes fairness is with a temporal formula.
<p>
You can also choose to specify <em>No behavior spec</em>.&nbsp;  This is the only option
if the spec has no variables.&nbsp;  With this option, TLC will just check assumptions and
evaluate a constant expression, if you have entered one in the
<a href="results-page.html#evaluate"><em>Evaluate Constant Expression</em> section</a>
of the <a href="results-page.html">Model Checking Results Page</a>.
</p>

<h2><a name="what-to-check">What to check?</h2>
There are three kinds of properties of the behavior spec that TLC can check:
<h3>Deadlock</h3>

A <em>deadlock</em> is said to occur in a state for which the next-state relation
allows no successor states.&nbsp;  Termination is deadlock that is not considered an error.&nbsp;
If you want the behavior spec to allow termination, then you should uncheck the
deadlock option.&nbsp;  (This is not necessary for the spec produced by translating a PlusCal algorithm,
because its next-state relation is written in a way that causes TLC not to consider normal
termination to be a deadlock.)

<h3>Invariants</h3>

An invariant is a state predicate that is true of all reachable states--that is, 
states that can occur in a behavior allowed by the behavior spec.&nbsp;  You can include
a list of invariants.&nbsp;  The checking of each invariant can be enabled or disabled
by checking or unchecking its box.


<h3>Properties</h3>

TLC can check if the behavior spec satisfies (implies) a temporal property, which
is expressed as a temporal-logic formula.&nbsp;  You can specify a list of such properties,
each with a check-box for enabling or disabling its checking.

<h2><a name="what-is-model">What is the model?</a></h2>

The most basic part of a model is an assignment of values to declared constants.&nbsp;
To assign a value to a constant, either double-click on the constant or select it and click on the&nbsp; 
<samp>Edit</samp>&nbsp; button.&nbsp;  This will raise a pop-up dialog giving you the choice
of three ways to assign a value to it:  
<dl>
<dt><b>Ordinary assignment</b></dt>
<dd>You can set the value of the constant to any constant TLA+ expression that
contains only symbols defined in the spec.&nbsp;  The expression can even include
declared constants, as long as the value assigned to a constant does not depend
on that constant.&nbsp;  (If there are circular dependencies, TLC will
produce a&nbsp; <samp>Java StackOverflowError</samp>&nbsp; error.)
</dd>
<br></br>
<dt><b>Model value</b></dt>
<dd>It assigns to the constant a model value of the same name.&nbsp;  (See
the <a href="model-values.html"><em>Model Values and Symmetry</em></a> 
help page.)
</dd>
<br></br>
<dt><b>Set of model values</b></dt>
<dd>You must enter a comma-separated list of legal model-value names,
optionally enclosed by&nbsp; <code>{</code>&nbsp;
and&nbsp; <code>}</code>.&nbsp;  You will have the option of making them
a symmetry set.  
<p>
A <em>typed</em> model value is one whose name begins with a letter
and an underscore--for example,&nbsp; <code>p_42a</code>.&nbsp;  If you
enter a set of model values that are not all of the same type,
you will have to click&nbsp; <samp>Next</samp>&nbsp;
to continue.&nbsp;  You will then be given the choice of specifying a type
for the set you have just entered.&nbsp;  For example, if you entered the
set&nbsp; <code>{2, a, b}</code>&nbsp; and choose the 
type&nbsp; <code>t</code>&nbsp;, the constant will be assigned the
set&nbsp; <code>{t_2, t_a, t_b}</code>&nbsp; of model values.&nbsp;
Note that a number like&nbsp; <code>2</code>&nbsp; is not a 
legal model value.
<p> See the <a href="model-values.html"><em>Model Values and Symmetry</em></a> 
help page to learn about typed values and symmetry sets.

</dd>

<h2><a name="how-to-run">How to run?</a></h2>

There are two basic ways to run TLC: locally on the  computer running the
Toolbox and remotely using multiple computers.&nbsp;  For local execution, you can choose
from a small number of useful options.&nbsp;  See the <a href="tlc-options-page.html">TLC Options Page</a>  for 
additional choices of how to run TLC.&nbsp;  Remote execution offers the possibility of
greatly speeding up execution through the use of a network of computers.&nbsp;
For information about the remote execution
options, see <a href="distributed-mode.html">Running TLC in Distributed Mode</a>.

</p>

<!-- MOVED TO TLC OPTIONS PAGE
   <h3>TLC Parameters</h3>
   There are two parameters that you can set here:


   <h4>Number of worker threads</h4>

   TLC's algorithm for computing the set (actually the graph) of reachable states
   is highly parallelizable, and it can make good use of arbitrarily many processors.&nbsp;
   This parameter specifies the number of separate threads that TLC will spawn to
   perform that computation.&nbsp;  You should not set it to be greater than the number of
   separate processors (cores) on your computer; the Toolbox will warn you if you do.

   <h4>Fraction of physical memory allocated to TLC</h4>

   This determines how large a heap TLC will use.&nbsp;  If you make it too small, TLC
   could run out of heap space and crash.&nbsp;  If you make it too large, your machine will not have
   enough memory and everything will run slowly.&nbsp;  The slider's color warns you if
   you are giving TLC too little or too much memory.&nbsp;
   TLC can keep the set of reachable states it has found
   on disk, so having too many reachable states can't run it out of memory.&nbsp;
   However, it runs much faster when it can keep those states in memory.&nbsp;
   TLC can run out of heap space if it takes too much memory to represent the
   set of initial states or the set of successor states of a single state.&nbsp;  
   If TLC does run out of memory in the middle of a long run,
   you can give it more and restart it from a checkpoint.
   
   <p> 
   
   Setting the this parameter too large may produce a 
   <em>Could not create the Java virtual machine</em> error.
   

   
   <A name="checkpoint"></A><h3>Checkpoint Recovery</h3></A>
   
    <p>
   TLC takes regular checkpoints, from which it can be restarted if it is
   stopped for any reason--for example, if your computer crashes.&nbsp; 
   
   The <em>Recover from checkpoint</em> option tells TLC to start from where it
   was when the last checkpoint was taken.&nbsp; 
   
   This option is enabled if the last time you ran TLC, it ran long enough to
   produce a checkpoint.&nbsp; The Toolbox will fill in the <em>Checkpoint
   id</em> for you.
    </p>
    <p>
   Warning: If you exit the Toolbox, it will stop any executions of TLC that are
   in process.&nbsp; 
   
   However, it is possible to stop the Toolbox in some drastic fashion that
   leaves TLC running as a background process.&nbsp; 
   
   Restarting from a checkpoint while the TLC process that created it is still
   running can cause the checkpoint to be destroyed, making recovery
   impossible.&nbsp; 
   
   If you have reason to believe TLC was not stopped, check to see if it is
   still running before trying to recover from a checkpoint. 
    </p>
    <p> 
   The checkpoint TLC produces after a short run does not take up
   much space.&nbsp;
   
   However, if TLC finds an error after running for a long time, the
   checkpoint files could take up a lot of space--sometimes on the order
   of a gigabyte for a model that has run for several days.&nbsp;
   
   These files are deleted if the model is re-run and a new checkpoint is
   produced, or if the model is validated when the
   <em>Recover from checkpoint</em> option is not selected.&nbsp; 
   
   When TLC has created a checkpoint, the <em>How to Run</em> section
   of the Model Overview page displays how much storage the checkpoint
   occupies.&nbsp; 
   
   It also provides a button that you can click to delete the checkpoint.&nbsp;
    </p>
   
   <p>
   Checkpointing does not yet work when TLC is run in distributed mode.
