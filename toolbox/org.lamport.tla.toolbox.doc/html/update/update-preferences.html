<h1>Scheduling automatic updates</h1>
<p>
You can configure the Toolbox update installer to automatically search for updates 
on a periodic basis.&nbsp; 

You can configure how these updates
are scheduled and performed from the 
<b>Automatic Update</b> <a href="../gettingstarted/preferences.html">preferences page</a>.&nbsp;

Checking the box at the top of the page enables automatic searching for and notification of available
updates.&nbsp;  
<p>
You can also opt-in to receive experimental features of the TLA Toolbox and TLC. Note though, that 
experimental features might not work as intended and can lead to bogus behavior. Not for the faint-hearted.</p>

The rest of the preference page then allows you to schedule the search and notification.
</p>
<h3>Update schedule</h3>
<p>You can choose among the following
schedules for checking for updates:</p>
<ul>
  <li>No automatic search</li>
  <li>On each startup (default)</li>
  <li>Every day at a specific time (e.g., 3:00PM)</li>
  <li>On a scheduled day of the week at a specific time (e.g., Monday 8:00AM)</li>
</ul>
<p>If the Toolbox is not running at the
scheduled time, the search will be done when the Toolbox is next started. 

</p>
<h3>Download options</h3>
<p>If you schedule for updates to be checked, you can choose whether or not
  to download (but not install) the new updates before notifying you.
</p>

<h3>When updates are found</h3>

<p>When a notification popup appears, you have the choice of either updating or deferring.&nbsp;
 
If you  defer the update, a preference determines if the notification pops up
again and, if so, when.

<h3>Network Connections</h3>
If your network environment requires you to setup proxy servers to connect to the internet, you can do so on the
Network Connections preference page found under <strong>General > Network Connections</strong>.

The <i>Active Provider</i> instructs the Toolbox to use no proxy server (Direct), use the system's proxy server 
(Native) or the manually defined ones (Manual). 

<ul>
  <li>Choosing the <i>Direct</i> provider causes all the connections to be opened without the use of a proxy server.</li>
  <li><i>Native</i> causes settings that were discovered in the operating system to be used (does not work on macOS).</li>
  <li>Selecting <i>Manual</i> causes settings defined in the <i>Proxy entries</i> table below to be used.</li>
</ul>

<p>
When using the Manual provider there are three predefined schemas to set settings for: HTTP, HTTPS and SOCKS.
Configuration for each schema is displayed in the <i>Proxy entries</i> table. To edit settings for a particular
schema double-click the entry or select the entry and click Edit... button.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Proxy bypass</i> table is only relevant for advanced use cases when different proxies need to be configured
to access different computers on the internet. Most users can ignore the <i>Proxy bypass</i> table.
</p>

Please ask your network administrator if the Toolbox fails to access the internet and you do not know what to enter.
