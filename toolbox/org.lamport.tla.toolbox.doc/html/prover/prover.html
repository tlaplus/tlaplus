<h1>Proofs</h1>

<p>
The current version of the TLA+ language contains
several features not described in 
   <em><a href=
    "http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/book.html" 
     target="_blank">
   Specifying Systems</a></em>.&nbsp;  

Chief among them are constructs for writing hierarchically structured
proofs.&nbsp;

The differences between the current and previous versions of TLA, including
the  proof language, are described
  <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/tla2.html"
    target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp;  
</p>

<p>

The Toolbox aids reading and writing hierarchically structured TLA+ proofs
by providing commands to view just the part of the structure that you
want to see.&nbsp;

These commands are described in the subtopic
<A href="reading.html">Viewing and Editing Structured
Proofs</A>.
</p>

<p>
TLAPS, the TLA+ Proof System, can be used to mechanically 
check TLA+ proofs.&nbsp; 

You can select the parts of a proof to be checked, and you can have the
Toolbox  display which steps' proofs have and have not been
checked.&nbsp;

The <a href="runningTlaps.html">Running TLAPS</a> subtopic
describes how to run it from the Toolbox.&nbsp;

But before you can run TLAPS, you must install it on your computer.&nbsp;

Instructions for doing this, as well as an explanation of how to use
TLAPS,  are on 
<A href="https://tla.msr-inria.inria.fr/tlaps/content/Home.html" target="_blank">the TLAPS
web page</A>.&nbsp; 

As described on that page, if you are using Windows, you will also have
to install 
<a href="http://www.cygwin.com/" target="_blank">Cygwin</a> on your computer.
</p>

<p>
When using TLAPS, you will need to use the module <code>TLAPS.tla</code> and perhaps other
TLAPS library modules.&nbsp;  The TLAPS download page will tell you in what
folder (directory) those modules are.&nbsp;  The  
<a href="../gettingstarted/tla-preferences.html#library-folders">TLA+ Preferences</a> page will allow
you to declare that modules from that folder should be usable in your specifications.
