<h2><a name="works">How TLAPS Works</a></h2>

<p>
TLAPS consists of a <i>Proof Manager</i> (PM) and various
<i>back-end provers</i>.&nbsp;

In TLA+, a proof of a theorem or proof step is either a leaf proof or a
sequence of steps, each of which may have a proof.&nbsp;


The PM translates a proof into a collection of
<i>obligations</i> whose correctness implies
the correctness of the proof.&nbsp;

A proof's obligations include the obligations of each subproof.&nbsp;

The PM calls one or more back-end provers to prove the obligations.&nbsp;
It then displays with colors the proof status of of each theorem or
proof step whose
proof it has checked.&nbsp;

The proof status of a step or theorem is determined by which of its proof's
obligations the back-end provers succeeded in proving.&nbsp;

The section titled <a href="#status-display">How the Toolbox Displays the Status of Proofs</a>
explains how you can completely customize the colors and their significance.

</p>




<h2><a name="running">Running the Proof Manager</a></h2>

<p>
Foremost, see the TLA+ Preferences &rarr; TLAPS preference page and assure that the Toolbox knows
where your tlapm has been installed; if it doesn't, you will see a notification like:
<br/>
<img src="no_tlapm.png" style="max-width: 100%; width: auto; height: auto;"/>
<br/>
If this is the case, click on the Browse... button and locate your executable.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Note:</b> if the spec currently has syntax or other problems which prevent it from being
	successfully parsed, the abilty to use the proof manager will remain disabled until the
	spec is correct and successfully parsed.
</p>

<p>
To tell the PM to check the proof of a theorem or step,
place the cursor (<i>not</i> the mouse pointer) on that theorem
or step and execute the command <i>Prove Step or Module</i>.&nbsp;

You can do this either from the menu you obtain by right-clicking in
the module editor, or by typing <code>Ctl+G Ctl+G</code>.&nbsp;

If you execute this command when the cursor is not at a theorem or step,
the PM will check all proofs in the module.&nbsp;

The PM can be executed with various options.&nbsp;

You will probably want to use only the default options.&nbsp;

Some that you might want to change for regular use can be set with
prefences, as described in the
<a href="#advanced">Advanced Execution Preferences</a> subsection below.&nbsp;

Even more esoteric PM options can be invoked using the <i>Launch Prover</i>
command described <a href="#launch">below</a>.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
The PM remembers the outcome of the back-end provers' attempts to prove
each obligation.&nbsp;

If the PM finds that an obligation has already been proved, its default
behavior is to
accept it as true and not send it again to a back-end prover.&nbsp;

Checking if an obligation has already been proved is fast, so there is no
harm telling the PM to prove something it has already proved.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
If something mysterious happens when running the PM and you think
something has gone wrong, you can try looking at the TLAPM
console, which you can display by using the
&nbsp;<samp>TLA Proof Manager</samp>&nbsp; menu at the top
of the Toolbox window.&nbsp;  It shows the output that
the PM sends to the Toolbox.

</p>

<h2><a name="stopping">Stopping a Proof</a></h2>

<p>When executing the PM, you can stop an individual proof or the entire execution.&nbsp;

As explained <a href="#interesting">below</a>, the Toolbox shows obligations that a
prover has been trying to prove for a while.&nbsp;

You can tell PM to stop proving that obligation by clicking on the <i>Stop Proving</i>
button at the top of the obligation.&nbsp;

You can stop the entire execution by clicking on the <i>Cancel</i> button of the
<i>Prover Launch</i> dialog.
</p>
<p>Note: If you check <i>Always run in background</i> on the <i>Prover Launch</i> dialog,
that dialog will stop popping up when you run the PM.&nbsp;

To get it back, go to <code>File/Preferences/General</code> and uncheck the
<i>Always run in background</i> preference.</p>

<h2><a name="status-display">How the Toolbox Displays the Status of Proofs</a></h2>

<h3><a name="obligations">The Status of Obligations</a></h3>
<p>
The PM displays with colors the proof status of steps and theorems
whose proofs it checks.&nbsp;

The status of a step or theorem depends on the results of checking its
proof obligations.&nbsp;

For each back-end prover and each obligation, there are five possible
statuses of the checking of that obligation by that prover:
<dl>
<dt><b>untried</b></dt>
<dd>The prover has not tried to prove the obligation.</dd>
<br></br>

<dt><b>proving</b> (also called <b>being proved</b>)</dt>
<dd>The prover is currently trying to prove the obligation.</dd>

<dt><b>proved</b></dt>
<dd>The prover successfully proved the obligation.</dd>
<br></br>

<dt><b>failed</b></dt>
<dd>The prover was unable to prove the obligation.</dd>
<br></br>

<dt><b>stopped</b></dt>
<dd>The user stopped the prover while it was trying to prove
the obligation.  How this is done is explained in
section <a html="#interesting">Interesting Obligations</a> below.</dd>
</dl>
TLA+ allows the leaf "proof":
<pre>
   OMITTED
</pre>
which indicates that the user has explicitly chosen to omit the proof.&nbsp;

In this case, the step is considered to have a dummy obligation whose status
is <b>omitted</b>.&nbsp;

TLA+ also allows incomplete proofs in which some proofs are
missing, usually because they have yet to be written.&nbsp;

In this case, the step is considered to have a dummy obligation whose
status is <b>missing</b>.&nbsp;
</p>

<h3><a name="colors">Logical Colors and Color Predicates</a></h3>

<p>
A step is colored with one of 12 logical colors, numbered from 1 through 12,
or else is uncolored.&nbsp;

Each logical color has an associated <i>color predicate</i> which is either
true or false, depending on the statuses of the step's proof obligations.&nbsp;

The step is colored with the lowest-numbered color whose color predicate
is true, or is left uncolored if all the color predicates are false.&nbsp;

Here is a picture of the the TLAPS &rarr; Color Predicates preference page showing the 12
colors and their default color predicates:
</p>
<pre>
     <IMG SRC=color-predicates.gif Align=bottom>
</pre>
<p>
The predicate for color 4 is true if and only if the user stopped
a back-end prover while it was proving one of the
proof's obligations.&nbsp;

The predicate for color 7 is true if and only if every obligation of the
proof was either proved by some back-end prover or is an omitted obligation
(a dummy obligation with status <b>omitted</b>).&nbsp;

The predicate <i>none</i> is never true.&nbsp;

The menu allows you to set a color's predicate to one of a number
of predefined predicates or to one of six user-defined predicates
named <i>user-defined A</i>, ... , <i>user-defined F</i>.&nbsp;

In addition to the predefined color predicates, you can also
choose any of six user-defined predicates.&nbsp;

The subsection <a href="#user-defined">User-Defined Color Predicates</a>
below explains how to define those color predicates.
</p>



<p>

A color's predicate can be set to be true only for
leaf steps (or theorems)--ones with no substeps--by checking the
&nbsp;<samp>Applies to Leaf Steps Only</samp>&nbsp; field.&nbsp;

The &nbsp;<samp>Show Leaf Steps in Side Bar</samp>&nbsp; field indicates if leaf steps
colored with that logical color should be highlighted by a mark on the
right-hand side of the
module editor, next to the appropriate point in the vertical scroll bar.&nbsp;


(These two choices are independent of one another.)&nbsp;

</p>
<p>
The picture shows the default physical colors corresponding to the
logical colors.&nbsp;

You can change a color by clicking on the appropriate colored button
on the preference page.&nbsp;

</p>

<h3><a name="interesting">Interesting Obligations</a></h3>

<p>
When checking a proof, the Toolbox displays <i>interesting obligations</i>
in a separate window.&nbsp;

Here is what can make an obligation interesting:
<ul>
<li>Some prover has failed to prove it.&nbsp;

The obligation can stop being interesting (and no longer displayed)
if the PM starts another prover to try proving it.&nbsp;
</li>

<br></br>

<li>Some prover has been proving it for some period of time (by default,
about 15 seconds).&nbsp;

In this case, you can stop the prover's attempt to prove
that obligation by clicking on the <samp>Stop Proving</samp> button
at the top of the obligation.&nbsp;

The obligation stops being interesting if the prover succeeds in
proving it.
</li>
</ul>
Clicking on an interesting obligation displays the location in the module
that generated the obligation.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
The obligation is a TLA+ representation of the exact mathematical fact
that the back-end prover is required to prove.&nbsp;

The back-end prover sees nothing except what the displayed obligation
contains.&nbsp;

For example, suppose your specification defines <code>Two</code> by
<pre>
   Two == 2
</pre>
A back-end prover will have no way of proving the obligation
<pre>
   1+1 = Two
</pre>
because it has no idea what <code>Two</code> means.&nbsp;

A proof that generates this obligation is incorrect because it fails
to indicate that the definition of <code>Two</code> must be used.&nbsp;
</p>

<h3><a name="updating">Updating Proof Statuses</a></h3>

<p>
When the proof is finished, either because there are no more obligations
to be checked or you have canceled the command from the <i>Prover Launch</i>
dialog, the colors shown in the module editor reflect the correct status
of the proof(s) that were checked.&nbsp;

Making a change to the module can change the obligations the PM
generates for a proof, changing the proof status of steps.&nbsp;

For example, changing the definition of a symbol is likely to change
the obligations for the proof of any formula containing that symbol.&nbsp;

A step's color is not changed to reflect changes to the module.&nbsp;

You can edit the module while running a proof, but the proof is performed
on the module as it was when TLAPS was launched.&nbsp;


</p>
<p>
Calling the PM to check the proof of a step (or a proof containing that
step)  causes the step's color to be updated appropriately.&nbsp;

(Remember that this entails no further proving if the proof's obligations
have not changed.)&nbsp;

You can also use the <i>Check Status of Step or Module</i> command
(<samp>Ctl+G&nbsp;Ctl+T</samp>) to update proof step colors.&nbsp;

This works just like the <i>Prove Step or Module</i> command, except
it does not do any proving.&nbsp;

It just computes the indicated steps' proof statuses based on the
status of its obligations obtained from proofs it has already attempted.&nbsp;

(It too displays interesting obligations.)&nbsp;

</p>

<p>
You can edit the module while the <i>Check Status</i> command is
running.&nbsp;

You can therefore issue the command to update the status of all the module's
proofs and let it run while you continue editing a proof.&nbsp;

A step's color will be determined by the module's contents when the
command was issued.&nbsp;

</p>

<h2><a name="errors">Finding Errors</a></h2>
<p>
There are some errors in a proof that are detected by the PM before sending a proof, or a proof obligation,
to the back-end provers.&nbsp;

These can be actual mistakes in the proof--for example, using a <code>TAKE</code> step when the
current goal is not a universally quantified formula.&nbsp;

They can also be TLA+ features not supported by TLAPS, such as quantification over tuples, as in
&nbsp;<code> \A &lt;&lt;x, y, z&gt;&gt; \in S : ...</x></code>&nbsp;.
</p>

<p>
Currently, the Toolbox does not always properly report errors found by the PM.&nbsp;

When you encounter a problem whose cause you can't figure out, try looking at the <em>TLAPS Console Log</em>,
which can be displayed from the <em>TLA Proof Manager</em> menu.
</p>



<h2><a name="advanced-topics">Advanced Topics</a></h2>
<h3><a name="advanced">Advanced Execution Preferences</a></h3>
The <i>TLAPS &rarr; Other Preferences</i> preference page allows you to specify the following Proof Manager
options.

<dl>
<dt>Number of Threads</dt>
<dd>
The PM normally uses as many processors (cores) as your computer possesses.&nbsp;

You may want to tell it to use fewer processors, which you can do by
setting this field appropriately.
</dd>
<br></br>

<dt>SMT Solver</dt>
<dd>
The Proof Manager can be directed to use an SMT solver as a back-end
prover.&nbsp;

This option tells the PM what SMT solver to use.&nbsp;

See the
<a href=
  "https://tla.msr-inria.inria.fr/tlaps/content/Documentation/Tutorial/Tactics.html#solvers"
 target="_blank">SMT solvers</a>
section of the
<a href=
  "https://tla.msr-inria.inria.fr/tlaps/content/Documentation/Tutorial/Tactics.html"
 target="_blank">Tactics page</a>.&nbsp;

(This field specifies the argument of the PM's <code>--solver</code>
option.)
</dd>
<br></br>

<dt>Do not trust previous results from earlier versions of provers</dt>

<dd>Selecting this option causes the PM to forget about previous results
of checking obligations obtained by
earlier versions of back-end provers.&nbsp;

You would select this option and redo your proofs if you are afraid that
bugs in an earlier version of one of the back-end provers could have
caused it to report that it had proved an incorrect obligation.
</dd>
</dl>
<h3><a name="launch">The Launch Prover Command</a></h3>

The <i>Launch Prover Command</i> (<code>Ctl+G Ctl+P</code>) can be
used to execute the PM with options that cannot be specified by using
the ordinary <i>Prove Step Or Module</i> command with appropriate preference
settings.&nbsp;

Issuing this command raises a dialog with which you choose the PM options
from the following selections.&nbsp;

<h4>Launch in Toolbox Mode</h4>

This is the normal option.&nbsp;  It causes the PM to determine
what proof(s) it checks just as it does for the ordinary
<i>Prove Step or Module</i> command.&nbsp;

Without it (or appropriate options provided in the
<i>Enter additional tlapm command-line arguments</i> field),
the PM will check the entire module and will uncolor all proof
steps.

<h4>Chose prover(s) to use</h4>
You must choose one of these options:
<dl>
<dt>Use Isabelle only if necessary</dt>
<dd>Do not have Isabelle check an obligation that has
already been proved by another back-end prover.&nbsp;
This is the normal option.&nbsp; </dd>
<br></br>

<dt>No proving</dt>
<dd>Do not call any back-end prover.</dd>
<br></br>

<dt>Check Zenon proofs with Isabelle</dt>
<dd>Use Isabelle to check proofs of obligations produced
by Zenon.</dd>
<br></br>

<dt>Do not use Isabelle</dt>
<dd>The PM will use Zenon or any other backend prover it should
except Isabelle.&nbsp;

It will not use Isabelle even if the proof specifies that an
Isabelle tactic should be used to check a proof.
</dd>
<dt></dt>


</dl>
<h4>Using previous results</h4>
You must choose one of these options:
<dl>
<dt>Use previous results</dt>
<dd>
Accept the results previously obtained by back-end provers.&nbsp;

This means that a back-end prover will not be called to prove
an obligation if it already succeeded or failed when trying to
prove the obligation.&nbsp;

This is the normal option.&nbsp;</dd>
<br></br>

<dt>Forget all previous results</dt>
<dd>Causes the PM to erase from its memory the
results of all previous attempts by back-end
provers to prove obligations.
</dd>
<br></br>

<dt>Forget currently selected previous results</dt>

<dd>Causes the PM to erase from its memory the
results of all previous attempts by back-end
provers to prove obligations of the currently-selected
proof(s).&nbsp;

If you think that the PM has gotten confused about
the proof status of an obligation, use this option together with
the <i>No proving</i>
option to get it to forget the status and do nothing else.

</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Paranoid checking</h4>

This tells the PM to call Isabelle to prove
obligations that the PM believes are trivially true and don't need
to be proved.

<h4>Enter additional tlapm command-line arguments</h4>

Tlapm is the program that implements the Proof Manager.&nbsp;

Do not even think of using this field unless you know what
command-line options tlapm accepts.&nbsp;

The field allows you to write additional
options exactly
the way they are written as command-line
options for tlapm.&nbsp;

These command-line options are appended to the ones generated by the
<i>Advanced Execution Preferences</i> and by the selections
made in the rest of the dialog.&nbsp;


If you are thinking about using this field,
you can probably figure out what those options are.&nbsp;

However, you will probably want to specify all the options yourself in
this field.&nbsp;

To cause the preference page to generate no options, use the default
settings of the <i>Advanced Execution Preferences</i>: all fields left
blank.&nbsp;

To cause the rest of the <i>Launch Prover</i> dialog to generate no options,
select only &nbsp;<samp>Do not use Isabelle</samp>&nbsp; and
&nbsp;<samp>Use previous results</samp>&nbsp;.



<h3><a name="user-defined">User-Defined Color Predicates</a></h3>

<p>
The <i>TLAPS &rarr; Other Preferences</i> preference page allows you to define color predicates.&nbsp;

You can define almost any color predicate you might want.&nbsp;

Here is a complete explanation of how.&nbsp;

Don't worry if you find the explanation hard to understand.&nbsp;

The Toolbox won't let you enter an illegal definition, and you
can experiment until you figure out how to write the definition
you want.


</p>
<p>
At any time, an obligation has a <i>state</i>.&nbsp;
For the dummy obligation representing a missing proof or
the proof <code>OMITTED</code>,
its state
is either <code>missing</code> or <code>omitted</code>.&nbsp; An ordinary proof
obligation's state consists of a status for each prover.&nbsp;
We consider there to be three provers:
<ul>
 <li>Isabelle</li>

 <li>Other, representing Zenon, the Cooper algorithm, and
any SMT backend prover</li>
 <li>The PM itself, which is considered to prove
     obligations that it finds trivial.
 </li>
</ul>

The possible statuses of these provers are:

<ul>

<li>Isabelle: <code>untried</code>, <code>proving</code>,
<code>proved</code>, <code>failed</code>, <code>stopped</code> </li>

<li>Other:     <code>untried</code>, <code>proving</code>, <code>proved</code>, <code>failed</code>, <code>stopped</code> </li>

<li>PM: <code>none</code>, <code>trivial</code> </li>

</ul>
The state of an ordinary obligation is written as a triple
such as <code>(proving</code>, <code>failed</code>, <code>none)</code>,
where the value of the <i>i</i><sup>th</sup> element
is the obligation's proof status for the <i>i</i><sup>th</sup> prover.
</p>

<p>
A color predicate is specified by two things:
<ul>
 <li>A set OS of obligation states.</li>
 <li>Whether it is an <i>every</i> or a <i>some</i> predicate.</li>
</ul>
An <i>every</i> predicate is true of a proof iff (if and only if)
 the state of every obligation of the proof is in OS.&nbsp;
A <i>some</i> predicate is true of a proof iff
the state of at least one of the proof's obligations is
in OS.
</p>

<p>
A color predicate is specified by a string with the following syntax
<pre>
   &lt;color-predicate&gt; ::=  ["every" | "some"] &lt;state-set&gt;*

   &lt;state-set&gt; ::= "missing" | "omitted"
                     | "(" &lt;statuses&gt; "," &lt;statuses&gt; "," &lt;statuses&gt; ")"

   &lt;statuses&gt; ::=  &lt;status&gt;* | "-" &lt;status&gt;+
</pre>

Each <code>&lt;state-set&gt;</code> specifies a set of states, and a
sequence of <code>&lt;state-set&gt;</code>s specifies their union.&nbsp;

The <code>&lt;state-set&gt;</code>s <code>"missing"</code> and <code>"omitted"</code>
specify the obvious singleton sets of dummy-obligation states.&nbsp;

A <code>&lt;statuses&gt;</code> specifies a set of possible prover statuses
as a list, where <code>"-"</code>, means <i>all statuses
except</i> and the empty list means all possible statuses.&nbsp;

A triple of sequences of statuses specifies the set of all states in
which the proof status of the <i>i</i><sup>th</sup> prover is one of
the statuses in the <i>i</i><sup>th</sup> component of the
triple.&nbsp;

An empty sequence of statuses is an abbreviation for all possible
statuses.&nbsp; For example, the <code>&lt;state-set&gt;</code>
<pre>
   (proving proved, untried, )
</pre>

is the set of all obligation states in which Isabelle's proof status
is either <code>proving</code> or <code>proved</code>, the Other
prover's status is <code>untried</code>, and the PM's prover status is either
<code>none</code> or <code>trivial</code>.&nbsp;

We can write a color predicate that is always true as: <pre>
   every missing omitted ( , , )
</pre>
The color predicate
<pre>
   some
</pre>
is false for every proof.&nbsp;  The predicate
<pre>
   every omitted (proved, , ) (, proved, ) (, , trivial)
</pre>
is true iff every obligation is either omitted, is proved by Isabelle
or the Other prover, or is found trivial by the PM.&nbsp; The predicate
<pre>
  some (failed, - proved, none) (- proved, failed, none)
</pre>

is true for a proof iff, for at least one of its obligations, either
Isabelle's status is <code>failed</code> and the Other prover's status
is not <code>proved</code>, or vice-versa, and the PM has not found it
to be trivial.&nbsp;
