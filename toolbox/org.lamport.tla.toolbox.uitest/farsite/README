The real root is DistributedSystemModule, but it might be slightly
simpler to try ClientModule or ServerModule separately.

The "small" spec starts at SpecificationModule.tla; that's the
"high-level" spec that assumes all the state is in a centralized
store.

The big spec starts at DistributedSystemModule.tla; that's the
"low-level" spec that spreads the state across asynchronous hosts.

They have some base modules in common.  I've included a visio diagram
of the module extension relationships.
