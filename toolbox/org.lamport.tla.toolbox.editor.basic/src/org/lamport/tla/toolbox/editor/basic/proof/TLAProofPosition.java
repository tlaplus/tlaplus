/**
 * Represents a proof and its statement (step/theorem) for folding.
 * 
 * The offset and length of this class describe the region from the beginning
 * of the statement of the proof to the end of the proof. The line containing
 * the offset is where the (+) or (-) symbol appears. There are some
 * modifications done to the exact offset and length because
 * of the way in which eclipse displays, collapses, and expands folds. This
 * is explained in comments in the constructor for this class.
 * 
 * The method {@link TLAProofPosition#computeProjectionRegions(IDocument)} computes
 * the regions that will be collapsed when this is collapsed. See that method
 * for a description of what is collapsed.
 * 
 * Instances of this class also maintains the {@link Position} of the statement
 * and the {@link Position} of the proof. This can be used to determine if a certain
 * offset is contained specifically within the proof or within the statement. There
 * are methods in this class for computing this. These positions are also used
 * to compute the correct foldable regions because when a {@link TLAProofPosition} is collapsed
 * we want to hide just the proof, not the statement.
 * 
 * Note that {@link Position}'s are added to a document to become sticky pointers
 * to locations. See {@link DefaultPositionUpdater} for the default implementation
 * of how sticky pointers are maintained for {@link Position}'s.
 * 
 * Note that the positions of the proof and statement are not interpretted by eclipse
 * in any way. Only the offset and length fields for this class (that are inherited
 * from {@link Position}) and the method {@link #computeProjectionRegions(IDocument)}
 * are used by eclipse to determine how the fold is displayed.

         * This seems to be a bit of a hack, but I see
         * no other way to do it correctly because of
         * how eclipse expands folds. In particular, when eclipse
         * is asked to expand a fold, it expands all lines between
         * the start line and end line, including the start line but
         * excluding the end line. It computes start
         * and end lines for a fold with offset and length in the following way:
         * 
         * start line: the greatest numbered line with
         *      first character offset <= offset of fold
         * 
         * end line: the greatest numbered line with
         *      first character offset <= offset + length of fold
         *      
         * In other words, it takes the offset of the fold and moves it back until it finds the start
         * of a line and takes the offset+length of a fold and moves it back until it finds the
         * start of a line. It then expands all lines in between and including the start line but excluding
         * the end line. See ProjectionViewer.addMasterDocumentRange() to see the exact implementation.
         * 
         * I think this is a silly way of doing things. The interface IProjectionPosition
         * allows the position to compute what lines are collapsed using the method
         * computeProjectionRegions but does not provide a way for the position to compute
         * what lines are expanded. This asymmetry can result in lines being collapsed
         * when a fold is collapsed but not re-expanded when the fold is expanded so that
         * lines just disappear. This requires being careful about the offset and length
         * of the position as well as what regions are collapsed.
         * 
         * The method alignRegion is stolen from the code for Java editor folding. Read the method
         * comments to see what it does. It should ensure that the entire proof is revealed
         * when expanded.

     * The following is from an email from Leslie. It starts by explaining
     * how comments should be used and folded in proofs and ends by describing
     * the folding rule.
     * 
     * In proofs, there are two
    ways I can think of for using comments:

    - At the beginning of a proof to explain the proof.  For example:

    <2>3. x > 0
      (********************************************************************)
      (* We prove y >0 and x \geq y by using Finagle's theorem and step   *)
      (* <1>3.                                                            *)
      (********************************************************************)
      <3>1. ...

    - As an informal leaf proof.  For example:

    <2>3. x > 0
     (*********************************************************************)
     (* This follows by simple algebra from <2>1 and <1>3, but I'm not    *)
     (* going to bother trying to convince this stupid prover that it     *)
     (* does.                                                             *)
     (*********************************************************************)

    <2>4. ...

    In this case, I will also want to add a PROOF OMITTED to tell
    the prover that I didn't just forget about this proof step.

    We can handle both these cases by the following rule, where the PROOF
    OMITTED follows the comment in the second case:

    When hiding a proof, hide everything from the (line following the)
    end of the statement being proved to the end of the proof.
