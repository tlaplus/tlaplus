 <h2><a name="values">Ordinary Model Values</a></h2>
 <P> 
A model must specify the values of all declared constants.&nbsp;
You will sometimes want to let a constant equal an unspecified value or a finite
set of unspecified values.&nbsp;  For example, the spec might have a 
constant&nbsp; <code>Proc</code>&nbsp; whose value 
represents a set of processes.&nbsp;
You could just let a process by a number, substituting an ordinary value 
  like&nbsp; <code>{1, 2, 3}</code>&nbsp;
for&nbsp; <code>Proc</code>&nbsp;.&nbsp;  However, a better way is to represent a process by a TLC
<em>model value</em>.&nbsp;  A model value is an unspecified value
that TLC considers to be unequal to any value that you can express
in TLA<sup>+</sup>.&nbsp;  You can substitute the 
  set&nbsp; <code>{p1, p2, p3}</code>&nbsp; of three model values
for&nbsp; <code>Proc</code>&nbsp;.&nbsp;  If by mistake you write an expression
like&nbsp; <code>p+1</code> where the value of&nbsp; <code>p</code> is
a process, TLC will report an error when it tries to evaluate that expression
because it knows that a process is not a number.&nbsp;  An important reason for
substituting a set of model values for&nbsp; <code>Proc</code>&nbsp; is
to let TLC  take advantage of symmetry, as described <a href="#symmetry">below</a>.
</P>
 
<P> 
There is one particular TLA<sup>+</sup> specification idiom
that requires you to substitute a model value for a defined operator.&nbsp;  
Here is typical example of this idiom.
<pre>
   NotANat == CHOOSE n : n \notin Nat
</pre>
It defines&nbsp; <code>NotANat</code>&nbsp; to be an arbitrary value
that is not a natural number.&nbsp;  TLC cannot evaluate this definition because
it cannot evaluate the unbounded&nbsp; <code>CHOOSE</code>&nbsp; expression.&nbsp;
To allow TLC to handle the spec, you need to substitute a model value
for&nbsp; <code>NotANat</code>&nbsp;.&nbsp;  The best model value to substitute for it
is one named&nbsp; <code>NotANat</code>&nbsp;.&nbsp;  You can do this with the
<a href="advanced-page.html#override">Definition Override</a> section of
the <a href="advanced-page.html">Advanced Options Page</a>.
</P>



<p>
There are some uses of model values that
can't be specified with the <a href="overview-page.html#what-is-model">What is the model?</a>
section of the <A href="overview-page.html">Model Overview Page</A>.&nbsp;  
If you encounter such a problem, you can declare your own set of model values
with the <A href="advanced-page.html#additional">Additional Definitions</a> section
of the <A href="advanced-page.html"> Advanced Options Page</A> and then use them
as ordinary values in expressions of the model.&nbsp;
</p>

<h2><a name="typed-values">Typed Model Values</a></h2>

<p>
Suppose that, by mistake, you write the 
expression&nbsp; <code>p=2</code>&nbsp; where&nbsp; <code>p</code>&nbsp; is
a process.&nbsp;  If you substitute a set of ordinary model values for the set
of processes, TLC will simply obtain the value&nbsp; <code>FALSE</code>&nbsp;
if it evalutes this expression, since it considers an ordinary model value 
to be different from any other value.&nbsp;  To allow TLC to detect this kind of error,
you can use a set of <em>typed</em> model values.&nbsp;  TLC considers a typed model value
to be unequal to any other model value of the same type.&nbsp;  However, it produces an
error when evaluating an expression requires it to determine if a typed model value
is equal to any value other than a model value of the same type or an ordinary model value.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
A model-value type consists of
a single letter, so there are 52 different types because&nbsp; <code>a</code>&nbsp;
and&nbsp; <code>A</code>&nbsp; are different types.&nbsp;  
(TLC actually accepts digits and underscore as types; don't use them.)&nbsp;
A model value has
type&nbsp; <code>T</code>&nbsp; if and only if its name begins with the two
characters&nbsp; <code>T_</code>&nbsp;.
</p>

<h2><a name="using">Using Model Values</a></h2>

<p>
A model value declared in the model can be used as an ordinary value in any expression that
is part of the model's specification.&nbsp;  For example, suppose your spec has a 
constant&nbsp; <code>Proc</code>&nbsp; that represents a set of processes 
and a constant&nbsp; <code>Leader</code>&nbsp; that is some element
of&nbsp; <code>Proc</code>&nbsp;.&nbsp;  You can substitute the 
set&nbsp; <code>{p1, p2, p3}</code>&nbsp; of model values
for&nbsp; <code>Proc</code>&nbsp; using the <em>Set of model values</em>
option of the <a href="overview-page.html#what-is-model">What is the model?</a>
section of the <A href="overview-page.html">Model Overview Page</A>.&nbsp;  You
can then 
substitute&nbsp; <code>p1</code>&nbsp;
for &nbsp; <code>Leader</code>&nbsp; using the <em>Ordinary assignment</em>
option of that section.
</p>

<p>
Model values can be declared in the following places:
<ul>
<li>When assigning a value to a constant parameter in the 
<a href="overview-page.html#what-is-model">What is the model?</a> section of
the <em>Model Overview Page</em>, by choosing the <em>Model value</em>
or <em>Set of model values</em> option.</li>
<li>When overriding a definition in the  <a href="advanced-page.html#override">Definition override</a> 
section of the <em>Advanced Options Page</em>, by choosing the  <em>Model value</em> option.
</li>

<li>
In the <a href="advanced-page.html#model">Model Values</a> section of the <em>Advanced Options Page</em>.
</li>
</ul>

</p>


<h2><a name="symmetry">Symmetry</a></h2>
<p>

Consider a specification of a memory system containing a declared 
constant&nbsp; <code>Val</code>&nbsp;  that represents the set of
possible memory values.&nbsp;   The set of memory values is probably a
<em>symmetry set</em> for the memory system's behavior specification, 
meaning that permuting
the elements in the set of values does not change whether or not
a behavior satisfies that behavior spec.&nbsp;  TLC can
take advantage of this to speed up its checking.&nbsp;

Suppose we substitute a 
set&nbsp; <code>{v1, v2, v3}</code>&nbsp; of model values
for&nbsp; <code>Val</code>&nbsp;.&nbsp;  We can use
the
<em>Symmetry set</em>
option of the <a href="overview-page.html#what-is-model">What is the model?</a>
section of the <A href="overview-page.html">Model Overview Page</A>
to declare this set of model values to be a symmetry set of the behavior spec.&nbsp;
This will reduce the number of reachable states that TLC has to examine
by up to 3!, or 6.  
</p>

<p>
You can declare more than one set of model values to be a symmetry set.&nbsp;
However, the union of all the symmetry sets cannot contain two 
typed model values with different types.
</p>
<p>
TLC does not check if a set you declare to be a symmetry set really
is one.&nbsp;  If you declare a set to be a symmetry set and it isn't, then
TLC can fail to find an error
that it otherwise would find.&nbsp;  Also, beware that using symmetry sets can
cause TLC to make mistakes when checking liveness properties.&nbsp;  Do not
use symmetry sets when checking liveness unless you know what you're
doing.
