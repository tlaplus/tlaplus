<a name="how-it-works"></a><h2>What can the profiler do?</h2>

<p>
Profiling a  specification is similar to profiling implementation 
code: During model checking, the profiler collects evaluation 
metrics about the invocation of expressions, their costs, as well 
as  action metrics. The number of invocations equals the number 
of times an expression has been evaluated by the model checker. 
Assuming an identical, fixed cost for all expressions allows to 
identify the biggest contributor to overall model checking time 
by looking at the number of invocations. This assumption however 
does not hold for expressions that require the model checker to 
explicitly enumerate data structures as part of their evaluation. 
For example, let S be a set of natural numbers from N to M such 
that N << M and \A s \in SUBSET S : s \subseteq S be a  
expression. This expression will clearly be a major contributor 
to model checking time even if its number of invocations is low. 
More concretely, its cost equals the number of operations 
required by the model checker to enumerate the powerset of S. 
Users can override such  operators with more efficient variants. 
Specifically, TLC allows  operators to be overridden with Java 
code which can usually be evaluated orders of magnitudes faster.
</p>
<p>
Evaluation metrics are captured globally and at the call-chain 
level. In other words, the metrics for an expression such as a  
operator, that occurs in two or more expressions, will be 
reported individually for each occurrence. Metrics are 
furthermore sensitive to constants such that the change of a 
constant value - across model checker runs - will be detectable 
in the metrics unless the constant has no influence at all.
</p>
<p>
Action metrics, which are orthogonal to evaluation metrics and 
are not found in an implementation profiler, are the total number 
of states and distinct states found which are reported at the  
action level.
</p>

<p>
The profiler neither requires the specification nor the model to 
be modified in order to collect metrics.

<a name="modes"></a><h2>Profiling modes</h2>

The profiler can be turned On to collect evaluation and action metrics, restricted to
action metrics only to debug action enablement, or switched off completely.  Overhead 
of profiling suggests to turn it off when checking large models. The control is located
on the TLC Options page of the Model.

<a name="ui"></a><h2>Profiling tab of the Model</h2>

The Toolbox overlays the evaluation and action metrics onto a module by coloring the 
exact locations of the corresponding expressions or  actions in the Spec Editor. Users 
can interactively drill into the call-chain scope by selecting individual expressions. 
Heatmaps allow to quickly navigate to the dominant contributors of model checking time 
as well as total states and distinct states found. Expressions with zero invocations 
and actions whose enablement predicate is never true - which are considered spec errors - 
are highlighted specifically.

<a name="limitations"></a><h2>Limitations</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Profiling only for the Spec and its invariants but not for liveness properties</li>
  <li>No support for distributed TLC</li>
  <li>Just profiling which incurs overhead, no sampling yet</li>
</ul>
