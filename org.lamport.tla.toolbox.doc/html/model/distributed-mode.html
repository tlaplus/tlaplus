<a name="how-it-works"></a><h2>How Distributed TLC Works</h2>

TLC has a collection of worker threads that do the actual
model checking--that is, they compute the graph of reachable states
and check invariants and other safety properties.&nbsp; There is also
a master thread that coordinates the worker threads.&nbsp; In ordinary
(non-distributed) mode, these threads all run on the same Java Virtual
Machine (JVM) on the same computer as the Toolbox.&nbsp; In
distributed mode, the threads can be run on multiple computers.&nbsp; 
The master thread runs on the same computer
as the Toolbox--a computer we call here the <i>master computer</i>.&nbsp; 
The threads are run on a collection of <i>slave computers</i>.&nbsp;  Each
slave computer can run multiple threads--the default is to run as many threads
as it has processors (cores).

<p>
TLC keeps fingerprints of all states that it has found, which it uses to 
determine if a newly computed state has already been examined.
&nbsp;

It writes the set of fingerprints to disk if it becomes too big to fit
in memory.&nbsp;  Having to read fingerprints from disk slows TLC down
considerably.&nbsp;  As explained below, you can have distributed TLC  distribute the
set of fingerprints to multiple slave computers (instead of keeping them
on the master computer).

</p>

<p> 
Unless you're just trying it out, you're running TLC in
distributed mode because your model is quite large.&nbsp;  

For any large model, it's a good idea to give TLC as much of the computer's memory
as is not needed by the operating system and other programs that will
be running at the same time.&nbsp;  This applies to TLC being run on the slaves
and on the master if slave fingerprint servers are not used.&nbsp;
</p>


<a name="running-master"></a><h2>Running the Master</h2>

<p>
TLC is run on a <a href="creating-model.html">model</a>.&nbsp;  

To specify that it is to be run in distributed mode, check the <i>Run
in distributed mode</i> box in the 
<a href="overview-page.html#how-to-run">How to run?</a>  section
of the Model Overview Page.  That section also allows you to adjust
the amount of memory allocated to the master.
</p>



<p>
For distributed mode, you may also want to add special arguments to
the command that launches the JVM that runs the master.&nbsp; As
explained <a href="#possible-problem">below</a>, one such argument may
be needed for the master and the workers to communicate.&nbsp; The
arguments are put in the <A href="advanced-page.html#jvmargs">JVM arguments</A> field
of the model's Advanced Options page.  </p>

<p> You start a TLC run in distributed mode as usual by clicking on
the <IMG SRC="run-icon.gif" Align="bottom"/> button, by selecting
<i>Run model</i> on the <i>TLC Model Checker</i> menu, or by typing
F11.&nbsp; This should cause the <i>Current status</i> field of the <a
href="results-page.html">Model Checking Results Page</a> to change to
<i>Master is waiting for (remote) workers</i> and then to indicate
that one or more workers have registered with the master.  </p>

<p>
If you want TLC to store the fingerprint set among slave computers,
you must run a (single) <i>fingerprint server</i> on each of them.&nbsp;
Your model must tell TLC how many fingerprint servers it will use.&nbsp;  If you
want fingerprints stored on 5 fingerprint servers (5 slave computers), you specify the following
<A href="advanced-page.html#jvmargs">JVM argument</A>:
 
<pre>
   -Dtlc2.tool.distributed.TLCServer.expectedFPSetCount=5
</pre>
</p>


<p>
If your model will run for a long time (days or weeks), you may not want to 
keep the Toolbox open for the entire run.&nbsp;  Instead, you can run TLC from 
a command line.&nbsp;  

The easiest way to do this is to create the model
in the Toolbox, and <a href="executing-tlc.html#validating">validate it</a>.&nbsp; 

You can then run distributed TLC with the following command, where <code>tool-path</code>
is the complete pathname of the directory containing the file <code>tla2tools.jar</code>
and <code>model-path</code> is is the complete pathname of the directory
<code>Spec.toolbox/ModelName</code>, with
<code>Spec</code> the specification's name and <code>ModelName</code>  the model's name
(see  <a href="executing-tlc.html#MC">How TLC is Run</a>):

<pre>
   java  -cp tool-path  tlc2.tool.distributed.TLCServer  model-path/MC
</pre>
Like the  JVM argument <code>-cp tool-path</code>, other JVM arguments can come between <code>java</code> 
and <code>tlc2.tool.distributed.TLCServer</code> in this command.  TLC options follow 
<code>model-path/MC</code>.
<!-- 
 E.g. with the 
<a href="executing-tlc.html#MC">model's subdirectory of the <code>.toolbox</code> directory</a> 
and the Toolbox's installation directory in /opt, the command line will look like:
<pre>
   java -cp /opt/toolbox/plugins/org.lamport.tlatools_1.0.0.201211261208 -Dtlc2.tool.distributed.TLCServer.expectedFPSetCount=5 tlc2.tool.distributed.TLCServer /home/user/DieHard/DieHard.toolbox/Model_1/MC
</pre>
-->
</p>

<a name="running-workers"></a><h2>Running the Slave Computers</h2>

<p>
The following are the basic steps that must be accomplished to start
the slaves.&nbsp;  The details of how these steps are performed will vary
according to the operating system and network configuration that you
are using.&nbsp;  If you have trouble getting distributed TLC to
work on your system, try finding help on the
  <A href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/tlaplus">TLA+ Google group</a>.
</p>

<p>
To run the slaves, you must have a network of computers that can
communicate with one another and with the machine running the master
and the Toolbox.&nbsp;  We assume that there is some some remote
management/administration system installed on the computers that run
the workers.&nbsp;  Examples of such a system are Remote Desktop (Windows),
ssh, rsh, and telnet.&nbsp;  A Java Runtime Environment (JRE), version 1.5
or later, must also be installed on the machines.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
There are two basic ways to run a slave computer computer.&nbsp;  In the following instructions,
<code>master-computer</code> is the name (or IP address) of the master computer.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>Method 1</b></dt>

<dd>
Start the Toolbox on the master computer.&nbsp;  Then do the following on a
shell on each slave computer:
<pre>
   wget http://master-computer:10996/files/tla2tools.jar
</pre>   
Then execute one of the following commands in that slave's shell:
<ul>
<li> To run just worker threads on the slave, execute:
<pre>
  java -cp tla2tools.jar tlc2.tool.distributed.TLCWorker master-computer
</pre> 
</li>

<li> To run just a fingerprint server on the slave, execute:
<pre>
  java -cp tla2tools.jar tlc2.tool.distributed.fp.DistributedFPSet master-computer
</pre>
</li>

<li> To run both worker threads and a fingerprint server on the slave, execute:
<pre>
  java -cp tla2tools.jar tlc2.tool.distributed.fp.TLCWorkerAndFPSet master-computer 
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The <code>wget</code> command downloads the file
<code>tla2tools.jar</code> into the current directory on the worker
machine, the <code>java</code> command actually starts the worker.&nbsp; The
<code>wget</code> command therefore just has to be executed the first
time you run a worker, and then whenever you install a new version of
the Toolbox.&nbsp; The <code>wget</code> command is not part of
Windows, but can be installed on Windows as part of Cygwin.  
<p>

<p>
You can add JVM arguments to the <code>java</code> command, such as the argument 
<code>-Xmx7G</code> that
gives the slave 7 gigabytes of memory.  
</p>
</dd>

<p> </P>
<dt><b>Method 2</b></dt>
<dd>
Start the Toolbox on the master computer, and then run a Web browser
on the worker computer.&nbsp;  In that web browser, enter the URL
<pre>
    http://master-computer:10996
</pre> This will display a Web page containing  buttons to launch
worker threads, a fingerprint server, or both on the slave.

<p>
You can launch the slaves with additional system properties and VM arguments
by adding them to the URL.&nbsp; (When you launch a slave from a command line, 
system properties [which begin with <code>-D</code>] and VM arguments are specified separately.)&nbsp; For example, the URL
<pre>
   http://localhost:10996/worker.jnlp?sysprops=-Diron.bar=5%20-Dfrob=2%20foo=&vmargs=-Xmx=512m%20-XX:MaxDirectMemorysize=512m
</pre>
causes the worker to be launched in a VM with VM arguments

   <code>-XX:MaxDirectMemorysize=512m</code> and
   <code>-Xmx=512m</code>
   
and system properties

   <code>-Diron.bar=5</code> and
   <code>-Dfrob=2</code>.


</p> 

<!-- COMMENTED OUT
<i>Launch worker from browser</i>.&nbsp; Clicking on that will
download the file <code>tla2tools.jar</code> and will execute it,
starting the worker.  
  END  COMMENTED OUT -->
</dd> </dl>

<p>
By default, each slave that runs workers runs as many worker threads
as it has processors.&nbsp;  Running that many threads on the slave might
cause problems with some operating system.&nbsp;   The following JVM argument causes
each slave to run 2 threads:
<pre>
   -Dtlc2.tool.distributed.TLCWorker.threadCount=2
</pre>
(This JVM argument is only applicable for slaves and has no effect if passed to the master process).
</p>

<h3><a name="possible-problem"></a>A Possible Problem</h3>

The master-computer name you use in the instructions above for running
the workers is usually a name like <code>jones-home-laptop</code> or
<code>tla.msr-inria.inria.fr</code>.&nbsp;  However, some computers have
multiple network interfaces, with different IP addresses--for example,
<code>192.168.1.10</code> and <code>10.10.0.1</code>.&nbsp;  If the master
computer is such a computer, then it's possible that using this name
as the master-computer name in the instructions above will cause the
worker not to be able to communicate with the master because they are
using different IP addresses.&nbsp;  To solve this problem, choose one of
those IP addresses--say <code>192.168.1.10</code>.  Use that address
as the master-computer name in the instructions above for running the
workers, add the following  <A href="advanced-page.html#jvmargs">JVM argument</A>
to the model:

<pre>
   -Djava.rmi.server.hostname=192.168.1.10
</pre>

<h4>Using Multi-Core Worker Machines</h4>
Currently, workers are single threaded.&nbsp;  You can take advantage of
multi-core computers by running multiple workers on the same computer,
using one of the previous methods to start each of the workers.&nbsp;
The major disadvantage of doing this is that a separate copy of 
the worker code is loaded into memory for each worker.

<a name="limitations"></a><h2>Limitations of Distributed Mode </h2>

When run in distributed mode, TLC does not use depth-first mode or simulation mode, even if one of
those modes is selected on the 
  <a href="advanced-page.html">Advanced Options Page</a>.&nbsp;

Coverage information is not provided.&nbsp; You should therefore check
a smaller model in ordinary non-distributed mode to make sure that the
specification specifies what you think it does.&nbsp;


<a name="help"></a><h2>Getting and Giving Help</h2>

You may want to run TLC in distributed mode with many workers.&nbsp;
(Preliminary tests suggest that linear speedup is possible even
with hundreds of workers.)&nbsp; Manually starting so many workers is
not practical.&nbsp; It is possible to implement scripts that can
automate the installation of the JRE and one of the two methods
described above for copying the <code>tla2tools.jar</code> file and
starting the workers.&nbsp; How this is done will depend on the
operating system and network configuration.&nbsp;
