<h1>Models</h1>

 <p> 
You run the TLC model checker on a <em>model</em> of your spec.&nbsp;  The model
tells TLC what it should do.&nbsp;  Here are the parts of the model
that you must explicitly choose:</p>
<ul>
<li>What the <a href="../spec/what-is.html">behavior spec</a> is.</li>

<li>What TLC should check.</li>

<li>What values to substitute for constant parameters.</li>
</ul>
 <p>
 The <em><a href="overview-page.html">Model Overview Page</a></em> 
 and <em><a href="advanced-page.html">Advanced Options Page</a></em> 
 help pages describe all the things that can go into a model.
 </p>

<p>

A specification may contain multiple models.&nbsp; You can create a
new model, open an existing one, or create a clone (a copy with a new
name) of an existing model by clicking on the&nbsp; <samp>TLC Model
Checker</samp>&nbsp; menu.&nbsp;



Alternatively, you can use the <a
href="../spec/opening-closing.html">Spec Explorer</a>.&nbsp; 

To create a new model, open the <a
href="../spec/opening-closing.html">Spec Explorer</a> and right-click
on the currently open spec.&nbsp; 

To open an existing model, open the spec's menu item (by clicking on
the&nbsp; <samp>+</samp>&nbsp;) and double-clicking on the
model.&nbsp; 

Right-clicking on the model also gives you the options of renaming it,
deleting it, and creating a clone.  </p>

<p>
A convenient way to examine all the spec's models 
is by selecting <a name="quick-access"><em>Quick Access</em></a> on the <em>Window</em> menu
or typing <code>Control+Shift+A</code>.&nbsp;  This raises a window showing the models
and the beginning of their <em>Model Description</em> fields.&nbsp;  Double-clicking
on a model opens it.&nbsp; 
You can also open
imported modules from that window.&nbsp;  Check out the window's <em>options</em> menu.
</p>

<p>
When you model check a spec, you should begin with a very small model--that is, a model for which the 
values substituted for constants (and perhaps a <a href="advanced-page.html#state">constraint</a>)
yield a small set of reachable states.&nbsp;  Before you've model checked it, your spec almost surely contains
quite a few errors.&nbsp;  Using a small model, TLC can find the trivial ones very quickly.&nbsp;  When it finds
no errors in a small model, you can then gradually increase the size of the model.
</p>

<p> 

As you run your spec on larger and larger models, it's easy to forget
what you've done.&nbsp; 

Instead of changing a model and running it again, create a new model
and keep the old one.&nbsp; (This is easy to do by cloning the model,
as described above.)&nbsp; 

You can identify your models with the <em>Model Description</em> field,
which is shown 
It will be easier to identify your models if you put the important
contents of the model in the model name--for example, you can name a
model </p> <pre>
   N=3,Proc={a1,a2,a3}
</pre>
<A name="locking">
The model is always locked while it is being run by TLC. This means that 
you can't view information in sections of a running model that are closed.&nbsp;

It's therefore a good idea to open all sections of the model
that you might want to look at before starting a TLC run that will
take a significant amount of time.&nbsp; 

If you forget to do this, you can clone the running model and examine
the clone.&nbsp;


<p>
The Toolbox saves a 
copy of the version of the spec on which the model was run or checked, so you can look at it even after you 
have changed the spec.&nbsp;
You can examine any modules in the saved version by clicking on the <i>Open Saved Module</i> command on the
<i>TLC Model Checker</i> menu when the model is selected.&nbsp;  (The model is selected when one of its pages has the focus.)&nbsp;   The 
<a href="executing-tlc.html#MC">How TLC is Run</a>
help-page section tells you where
those saved modules are saved.
