 <P> 
The Toolbox is far from perfect.&nbsp;  Below are some hints for getting out of
trouble if it misbehaves, and instructions for reporting bugs.&nbsp;
Please be patient, we're doing the best we can.&nbsp;  We and our other users would greatly
appreciate any help you can give us.&nbsp;  <a href="../help-us/help-us.html">Click
here</a> to find out how you can help.
 </P>

<h2><a name="trouble">Getting Out of Trouble</a></h2>
<p>
Errors in the Toolbox can cause it to get into a bad state.&nbsp;  The best thing to 
do if this happens is to back out of what you were doing and try again.&nbsp;  You should try to back
out only as far as necessary. 
</p>

<h3>Backing Out of a Model</h3>

<p>
If you try running TLC and nothing seems to be happening, 
see <a href="../model/executing-tlc.html#crash">If Something Crashes</a>.&nbsp;
Looking at <a href="../model/executing-tlc.html#console">The TLC Console View</a> can help you figure out
what state TLC is in.&nbsp;  It's possible that the problem is with the model.&nbsp;
A problem with a model can also be caused by editing the model, or by
editing and re-parsing the spec.
</p>

<p>
Closing the model (by clicking on the&nbsp; <samp>X</samp>&nbsp; in the model editor's tab) and re-opening it
(with the&nbsp; <samp>TLC Model Checker/Open Model</samp>&nbsp; menu item) may solve the problem.&nbsp;
If not, try cloning the model and deleting the original.&nbsp; 
(See the <a href="../model/about-models.html"><em>Models</em></a>
help page.)&nbsp;  If the problem persists in the cloned model, try creating a new model.&nbsp;  If that
too has problems, try backing out of the spec.
</p>

<h3>Backing Out of a Spec</h3>
<p>

If the Toolbox gets into a bad state when you're editing a module, or
when you have a problem with a TLC model that can't be solved by backing
out of the model, you should try backing out of the spec.&nbsp; 

The first thing to try is closing the spec,
refresh the spec by right-clicking on its entry 
in the <a href="#spec-explorer">Spec Explorer</a>,
and re-opening the spec.&nbsp; 
(See the <a href="../spec/opening-closing.html"><em>Manipulating
Specs</em></a> help page.)&nbsp; 

If that doesn't work, try exiting from and then restarting the
Toolbox.&nbsp; 

If that fails, delete the original spec.&nbsp; 

However, if you have models that you don't want to lose, first make a
copy of the <code>.toolbox</code> directory under some other name.&nbsp;

If that works, try creating a new spec with the same root
module.&nbsp;  

If you have saved a copy of the old <code>.toolbox</code> directory,
you can first restore that directory and see if you can open it with
the <code>Import existing models</code> option.&nbsp;  

If not, you will have to try creating a new spec with the same modules
but without your saved models.&nbsp;

If you can't restore the spec, see if the problem exists with other
specs.&nbsp;

If it does, you will probably have to back out of the Toolbox.&nbsp;

If not, see if you can figure out what it is about that particular
spec that is causing the problem.

</p>

<h3><a name="backing-out">Backing Out of the Toolbox</a></h3>

<p>
If all else fails, you will have to re-initialize the Toolbox.&nbsp;  This is done by exiting the Toolbox
and deleting all its state information from the disk.&nbsp;  However, before doing this, save the relevant
part of the Toolbox's&nbsp; <code>.log</code>&nbsp; file as described in <a href="#reporting">Reporting Problems</a> below.
</p>
<p>
The Toolbox keeps its state in a folder named &nbsp;<code>workspace</code>&nbsp; that it creates in the
folder from which you run the Toolbox.&nbsp;  Deleting (or renaming) the &nbsp;<code>workspace</code>&nbsp; folder (when the Toolbox
is not running) causes the Toolbox
to start in its initial state the next time you execute it.&nbsp;  It will then show no existing specs.&nbsp;
However, the information about the individual specs that existed when you deleted 
the&nbsp; <code>workspace</code>&nbsp; folder is still there.&nbsp;
If you had a spec named&nbsp; <samp>SName</samp>&nbsp;, 
the state of that spec was saved in a folder named&nbsp; <samp>SName.toolbox</samp>&nbsp;.&nbsp;
If you open a spec with that name having the same root module, the Toolbox will give you
the option of reloading that state, which includes the state of all its models.&nbsp;
If you're lucky, that spec will work fine.&nbsp;  If not, you'll have to delete the spec 
(which deletes the&nbsp; <code>.toolbox</code>&nbsp; folder) and re-create
it from scratch.&nbsp;  Of course, the module files will still be there.
</p>

<h2><a name="reporting">Reporting Problems</a></h2>
<p>

We can't fix a problem with the Toolbox if we don't know about
it.&nbsp; 

Please report any problem you encounter--be it a bug or something you
found confusing or poorly explained.&nbsp;  

You can enter a bug report in
 <A href="https://tlaplus.codeplex.com/workitem/list/basic", target="_blank">our 
CodePlex bug database</A>.&nbsp; 

However, please search the database first to make sure that we don't
already know about it.&nbsp; 

</p>

<p>
When reporting a bug, please include all details.&nbsp; 

It will be helpful if you can include the relevant part of the
Toolbox's log, which is the file named&nbsp; <samp>.log</samp>.&nbsp;

The &nbsp; <samp>.log</samp>&nbsp; file is in the 
&nbsp; <samp>.tlaplus/.metadata/</samp> folder in your home 
directory.&nbsp; 

On Windows, you can find out where your home directory is located, by 
by entering the command <code>echo %SYSTEMDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%</code> in 
Command Prompt.&nbsp; On Linux and Mac, check the $HOME variable.&nbsp;

(The log contains enough timestamped entries for you to figure out
what part of it relates to the problem you are reporting.)&nbsp;
