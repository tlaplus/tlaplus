<h1>Scheduling automatic updates</h1>
<p>You can configure the Toolbox update to automatically search for updates to the installed software 
on a periodic basis. You can configure how these updates
are scheduled and performed from the <b>Install/Update &gt; Automatic Updates</b> preference page.
</p>
<h3>Scheduling options</h3>
<p>Each time the Toolbox starts, the update scheduler will
activate based on the chosen scheduling. You can choose between the following
update policies:</p>
<ul>
  <li>No automatic search</li>
  <li>On each startup (default)</li>
  <li>Every day at a specific time (i.e. 3:00PM) *</li>
  <li>On a scheduled day of the week at a specific time (i.e. Monday 8:00AM) *</li>
</ul>
<p>* assuming the application is active. If the application is not active at a 
scheduled time and the search is past due, it will immediately start on the next 
startup</p>
<h3>Download options</h3>
<p>Scheduling options define when searches are performed but do not 
define what actually happens when updates are found. Download options 
control this behavior (this set of options is disabled if automatic search is 
turned off). You can choose between:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Search for updates and notify me when they are available (default)</li>
  <li>Download new updates automatically and notify me when ready to install them</li>
</ul>
<p>In both cases, the update scheduler will execute in the background 
when necessary based on the scheduling options. There will be no messages if no 
updates are found. If there are updates, the behavior will depend on the 
chosen download option.</p>
<h4>Search and notify</h4>
<p>If search only is selected, a popup will appear notifying you that updates
have been found, and an updates icon will appear in the status bar.  
You may click on the popup to review the list of updates. The 
same <a href="run-update.html">Available Updates wizard</a>
 is used when you search for updates manually using
<a class="command-link" href='javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.equinox.p2.ui.sdk.update")'>
  <img src="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.help/command_link.png">
  <b>Help &gt; Check for Updates</b></a>.</p>
  <p>If you do not wish to update the Toolbox right away, you may dismiss the notification
  popup by clicking on the <font color="#0000FF">[X]</font> in the corner of the popup.  When you are ready to review
  the updates, you may then click on the update icon in the status bar.
  </p>
<h4>Download new updates</h4>
<p>If the second option has been selected (download updates automatically), the 
search will be scheduled as before, but when new updates are found, the 
download will commence immediately. When all the features have been successfully 
downloaded, a popup will appear notifying you that updates have been found
and downloaded, and an updates icon will appear in the status bar.
You may click on the popup to review the list of updates. The 
same <a href="run-update.html">Available Updates wizard</a>
 is used when you search for updates manually using
<a class="command-link" href='javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.equinox.p2.ui.sdk.update")'>
  <img src="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.help/command_link.png">
  <b>Help &gt; Check for Updates</b></a>.</p>
  <p>If you do not wish to update the Toolbox right away, you may dismiss the notification
  popup by clicking on the <font color="#0000FF">[X]</font> in the corner of the popup.  When you are ready to review
  the updates, you may then click on the update icon in the status bar.  The software that was downloaded
  will be used the next time you update the system.
  </p>
  <h3>Reminder options</h3>
<p>Reminder options define what happens when updates are found.
You can choose between:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Notify me once about updates (default)</li>
  <li>Remind me about updates.  This option lets you choose the time
  interval for being reminded about updates.</li>
</ul>
<p>In either case, a popup will appear when updates are available.  Clicking
the popup will open the <a href="run-update.html">Available Updates wizard</a>
so that you can review the updates.  If you do not wish to update your system right away, 
you may dismiss the notification popup by clicking on the <font color="#0000FF">[X]</font> in the corner of the popup.  
If you have selected a time interval for reminders, the popup will appear when the
specified interval has passed.
