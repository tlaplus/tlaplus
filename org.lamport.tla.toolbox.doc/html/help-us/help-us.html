<h1>Please Help Us</h1>

 <P> 
The initial version of the
TLA<sup>+</sup> Toolbox was designed and programmed almost entirely by
Simon Zambrovski in less than a year.&nbsp;  The Toolbox is now being maintained and developed 
by Daniel Ricketts.&nbsp;   Leslie Lamport has acted as mentor.
 </P>

<p>
The Toolbox is written as an Eclipse RCP (Rich Client Platform)
application.&nbsp;  This has made it possible to implement a great deal of functionality
in a fairly short time.&nbsp;  It has also led to compromises.&nbsp;  There are things
we would like the Toolbox to do that it doesn't.&nbsp;  Some of the inadequacies
are due to a lack of time; others are because we have been unable to 
figure out how to implement them in Eclipse--either because Eclipse
lacks the necessary functionality, or because we don't know how to do them
in Eclipse.
</p>

<p>
Another problem we have faced is the difficulty of debugging this kind
of interactive application.&nbsp;  We have not had the time to do the kind
of exhaustive testing that's needed to find and eliminate bugs.&nbsp;  
In particular, we have not done much testing on platforms other than
Windows.&nbsp;  We expect there to be many bugs that show up only on other
platforms.
</p>

<p>
We can use your help.&nbsp;  Let us know about problems you encounter
or about any aspect
of the Toolbox that you don't like.&nbsp;  We also want to know
what important features you feel the Toolbox lacks.&nbsp;  Below is
a list of some of the features we are thinking of adding.&nbsp;
We probably won't have time to add them all, so we want
to know which of them you would most like.&nbsp;  And we would
love your help in debugging and developing the Toolbox.&nbsp;  
Contact <a href="http://lamport.org" target="_blank">Leslie Lamport</a>
with your feedback.
</p>

<h2>Some Features We May Add</h2>

<h3>A TLA<sup>+</sup> Tutorial</h3>

A tutorial on specifying systems with TLA<sup>+</sup>
and checking the specifications with the TLA<sup>+</sup> tools is being written.&nbsp;
It is based on the Toolbox.&nbsp;  The current, highly incomplete version, is available;
see the <a href="http://tlaplus.net">TLA+ web site</a>.
We do not know whether
the tutorial will be incorporated within the Toolbox itself.

<h3>Better Support for PlusCal</h3>

<p>
Errors in expressions in a PlusCal algorithm are manifest
as parsing errors or TLC errors in the corresponding expressions
of the algorithm's TLA<sup>+</sup> translation.&nbsp;  We would like
to have the Toolbox mark the locations of those errors in the
PlusCal code.
</p>

<p>The pretty-printer does not yet properly format PlusCal algorithms.&nbsp;  We would like
it to.</p>

<h3>Support for the TLA<sup>+</sup> Proof System</h3>

A TLA<sup>+</sup> proof checker is under development at the 
<a href="http://www.msr-inria.inria.fr/Projects/tools-for-formal-specs">Microsoft Research-Inria Joint Centre</a>.&nbsp;
We expect to add at least a basic level of support for writing and checking proofs within the Toolbox.
