<h1>TLA+ Preferences</h1>

<p>There are two preferences that can be set on this page.</p>

<h3>Continue Previous Session on Restart</h3>

This option allows you to choose whether, when you close the Toolbox, it
resumes from where you were (the default) or opens the Welcome View.

<h3>Minimum spec storage displayed</h3>

<p>
The Toolbox keeps all the information about a specification name
<code>Spec</code>, other than its actual files, in a folder named
<code>Spec.toolbox</code>.&nbsp;

When that folder becomes sufficiently large, its size is
shown near the bottom right-hand corner of the Toolbox window.&nbsp;

This parameter specifies how large (in kilobytes) <em>sufficiently large</em>
is.&nbsp; 

The default is 50 megabytes.
</p>

<p>
When the <code>.toolbox</code> folder becomes very large, it is probably
because it contains one or more checkpoints created by TLC.&nbsp;

The checkpoint is deleted if TLC completes successfully, but is saved
if TLC is stopped or finds an error.&nbsp;

A TLC execution that takes several days can create a checkpoint
with more than a gigabyte of data.&nbsp;

When a spec uses a lot of space, you should view the 
<A href="../model/about-models.html">TLC models</A> you have created for it
to see if any have large checkpoints.&nbsp;

See <A href="../model/overview-page.html#checkpoint">Checkpoint 
Recovery</A> to learn how you can find out how large a checkpoint
is and how you can delete a checkpoint.
