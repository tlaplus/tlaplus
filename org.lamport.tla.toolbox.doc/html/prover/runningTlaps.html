<h2><a name="works">How TLAPS Works</a></h2>

<p>
TLAPS consists of a <i>Proof Manager</i> (PM) and various 
<i>back-end provers</i>.&nbsp;

In TLA+, a proof of a theorem or proof step is either a leaf proof or a 
sequence of steps, each of which may have a proof.&nbsp;


The PM translates a proof into a collection of 
<i>obligations</i> whose correctness implies
the correctness of the proof.&nbsp;  

A proof's obligations include the obligations of each subproof.&nbsp;

The PM calls one or more back-end provers to prove the obligations.&nbsp;
It then displays with colors the proof status of of each theorem or 
proof step whose
proof it has checked.&nbsp;

The proof status of a step or theorem is determined by which of its proof's
obligations the back-end provers succeeded in proving.&nbsp;  

The section titled <a href="#status-display">How the Toolbox Displays the Status of Proofs</a>
explains how you can completely customize the colors and their significance.

</p>




<h2><a name="running">Running the Proof Manager</a></h2>


<p>
To tell the PM to check the proof of a theorem or step,
place the cursor (<i>not</i> the mouse pointer) on that theorem
or step and execute the command <i>Prove Step or Module</i>.&nbsp;

You can do this either from the menu you obtain by right-clicking in
the module editor, or by typing <code>Ctl+G Ctl+G</code>.&nbsp;

If you execute this command when the cursor is not at a theorem or step,
the PM will check all proofs in the module.&nbsp;

The PM can be executed with various options.&nbsp;

You will probably want to use only the default options.&nbsp;

Some that you might want to change for regular use can be set with
prefences, as described in the 
<a href="#advanced">Advanced Execution Preferences</a> subsection below.&nbsp;

Even more esoteric PM options can be invoked using the <i>Launch Prover</i>
command described <a href="#launch">below</a>.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
The PM remembers the outcome of the back-end provers' attempts to prove
each obligation.&nbsp;

If the PM finds that an obligation has already been proved, its default
behavior is to 
accept it as true and not send it again to a back-end prover.&nbsp;

Checking if an obligation has already been proved is fast, so there is no
harm telling the PM to prove something it has already proved.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
If something mysterious happens when running the PM and you think
something has gone wrong, you can try looking at the TLAPM
console, which you can display by using the 
&nbsp;<samp>TLA Proof Manager</samp>&nbsp; menu at the top
of the Toolbox window.&nbsp;  It shows the output that
the PM sends to the Toolbox.

</p>

<h2><a name="status-display">How the Toolbox Displays the Status of Proofs</a></h2>

<h3><a name="obligations">The Status of Obligations</a></h3>
<p>
The PM displays with colors the proof status of steps and theorems
whose proofs it checks.&nbsp; 

The status of a step or theorem depends on the results of checking its
proof obligations.&nbsp;  

For each back-end prover and each obligation, there are five possible
statuses of the checking of that obligation by that prover:
<dl>
<dt><b>untried</b></dt>
<dd>The prover has not tried to prove the obligation.</dd>
<br></br>

<dt><b>proving</b> (also called <b>being proved</b>)</dt>
<dd>The prover is currently trying to prove the obligation.</dd>

<dt><b>proved</b></dt>
<dd>The prover successfully proved the obligation.</dd>
<br></br>

<dt><b>failed</b></dt>
<dd>The prover was unable to prove the obligation.</dd>
<br></br>

<dt><b>stopped</b></dt>
<dd>The user stopped the prover while it was trying to prove
the obligation.  How this is done is explained in
section <a html="#interesting">Interesting Obligations</a> below.</dd>
</dl>
TLA+ allows the leaf "proof":
<pre>
   OMITTED
</pre>
which indicates that the user has explicitly chosen to omit the proof.&nbsp;
 
In this case, the step is considered to have a dummy obligation whose status
is <b>omitted</b>.&nbsp;  

TLA+ also allows incomplete proofs in which some proofs are
missing, usually because they have yet to be written.&nbsp; 

In this case, the step is considered to have a dummy obligation whose
status is <b>missing</b>.&nbsp;
</p>

<h3><a name="colors">Logical Colors and Color Predicates</a></h3>

<p>
A step is colored with one of 12 logical colors, numbered from 1 through 12,
or else is uncolored.&nbsp;

Each logical color has an associated <i>color predicate</i> which is either
true or false, depending on the statuses of the step's proof obligations.&nbsp;

The step is colored with the lowest-numbered color whose color predicate
is true, or is left uncolored if all the color predicates are false.&nbsp;

Here is a picture of the main TLAPS preference page showing the 12 
colors and their default color predicates:
</p>
<pre>
     <IMG SRC=color-predicates.gif Align=bottom> 
</pre>
<p>
The predicate for color 4 is true if and only if the user stopped
a back-end prover while it was proving one of the 
proof's obligations.&nbsp;

The predicate for color 7 is true if and only if every obligation of the
proof was either proved by some back-end prover or is an omitted obligation
(a dummy obligation with status <b>omitted</b>).&nbsp;

The predicate <i>none</i> is never true.&nbsp;

The menu allows you to set a color's predicate to one of a number
of predefined predicates or to one of six user-defined predicates
named <i>user-defined A</i>, ... , <i>user-defined F</i>.&nbsp;

In addition to the predefined color predicates, you can also
choose any of six user-defined predicates.&nbsp;

The subsection <a href="#user-defined">User-Defined Color Predicates</a>
below explains how to define those color predicates.
</p>



<p>

A color's predicate can be set to be true only for
leaf steps (or theorems)--ones with no substeps--by checking the
&nbsp;<samp>Applies to Leaf Steps Only</samp>&nbsp; field.&nbsp;

The &nbsp;<samp>Show Leaf Steps in Side Bar</samp>&nbsp; field indicates if leaf steps
colored with that logical color should be highlighted by a mark on the 
right-hand side of the
module editor, next to the appropriate point in the vertical scroll bar.&nbsp;


(These two choices are independent of one another.)&nbsp;

</p>
<p>
The picture shows the default physical colors corresponding to the
logical colors.&nbsp;

You can change a color by clicking on the appropriate colored button
on the preference page.&nbsp;

(Because of an Eclipse bug, this doesn't work on the Macintosh.&nbsp;
Instead, you should click on the <i>Set Colors</i> button at the
bottom of the preference page.)&nbsp;
</p>

<h3><a name="interesting">Interesting Obligations</a></h3>

<p>
When checking a proof, the Toolbox displays <i>interesting obligations</i> 
in a separate window.&nbsp;  

Here is what can make an obligation interesting:
<ul>
<li>Some prover has failed to prove it.&nbsp;  

The obligation can stop being interesting (and no longer displayed)
if the PM starts another prover to try proving it.&nbsp;
</li>

<br></br>

<li>Some prover has been proving it for some period of time (by default,
about 15 seconds).&nbsp;  

In this case, you can stop the prover's attempt to prove
that obligation by clicking on the <samp>Stop Proving</samp> button
at the top of the obligation.&nbsp;

The obligation stops being interesting if the prover succeeds in 
proving it.
</li>
</ul>
Clicking on an interesting obligation displays the location in the module
that generated the obligation.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
The obligation is a TLA+ representation of the exact mathematical fact
that the back-end prover is required to prove.&nbsp;  

The back-end prover sees nothing except what the displayed obligation 
contains.&nbsp;

For example, suppose your specification defines <code>Two</code> by
<pre>
   Two == 2
</pre>
A back-end prover will have no way of proving the obligation
<pre>
   1+1 = Two
</pre> 
because it has no idea what <code>Two</code> means.&nbsp;  

A proof that generates this obligation is incorrect because it fails
to indicate that the definition of <code>Two</code> must be used.&nbsp;
</p>

<h3><a name="updating">Updating Proof Statuses</a></h3>

<p>
When the proof is finished, either because there are no more obligations
to be checked or you have canceled the command from the <i>Prover Launch</i>
dialog, the colors shown in the module editor reflect the correct status
of the proof(s) that were checked.&nbsp;

Making a change to the module can change the obligations the PM 
generates for a proof, changing the proof status of steps.&nbsp;

For example, changing the definition of a symbol is likely to change
the obligations for the proof of any formula containing that symbol.&nbsp;

(Such a change cannot be made while a proof is being checked because
the module cannot be edited until the proof is finished.)&nbsp;

However, a step's color is not changed to reflect changes to its
proof status.&nbsp;

</p>
<p>
Calling the PM to check the proof of a step (or a proof containing that
step)  causes the step's color to be updated appropriately.&nbsp; 

(Remember that this entails no further proving if the proof's obligations
have not changed.)&nbsp;

You can also use the <i>Check Status of Step or Module</i> command
(<samp>Ctl+G&nbsp;Ctl+T</samp>) to update proof step colors.&nbsp;

This works just like the <i>Prove Step or Module</i> command, except
it does not do any proving.&nbsp;

It just computes the indicated steps' proof statuses based on the
status of its obligations obtained from proofs it has already attempted.&nbsp;

(It too displays interesting obligations.)&nbsp;

</p>

<p>
You can edit the module while the <i>Check Status</i> command is
running.&nbsp;  

You can therefore issue the command to update the status of all the module's
proofs and let it run while you continue editing a proof.&nbsp;

A step's color will be determined by the module's contents when the
command was issued.&nbsp;  

</p>


<h2><a name="advanced-topics">Advanced Topics</a></h2>
<h3><a name="advanced">Advanced Execution Preferences</a></h3>
The <i>Additional Preferences</i> subpage of the main <i>TLAPS</i>
preference page allows you to specify the following Proof Manager
options.

<dl>
<dt>Number of Threads</dt>
<dd>
The PM normally uses as many processors (cores) as your computer possesses.&nbsp;

You may want to tell it to use fewere processors, which you can do by
setting this field appropriately.
</dd>
<br></br>

<dt>SMT Solver</dt>
<dd>
The Proof Manager can be directed to use an SMT solver as a back-end
prover.&nbsp;

This option tells the PM what SMT solver to use.&nbsp;

See the  
<a href=
  "http://msr-inria.inria.fr/~doligez/tlaps/advanced-tutorial.html#backends"
 target="_blank">Using different backends</a>
section of the advanced 
<a href="http://msr-inria.inria.fr/~doligez/tlaps/"
   target="_blank">TLAPS documentation</a>.&nbsp;

(This field specifies the argument of the PM's <code>--solver</code>
option.)
</dd>
<br></br>

<dt>Do not trust previous results from earlier versions of provers</dt>

<dd>Selecting this option causes the PM to forget about previous results 
of checking obligations obtained by
earlier versions of back-end provers.&nbsp;

You would select this option and redo your proofs if you are afraid that
bugs in an earlier version of one of the back-end provers could have 
caused it to report that it had proved an incorrect obligation. 
</dd>
</dl>
<h3><a name="launch">The Launch Prover Command</a></h3>

The <i>Launch Prover Command</i> (<code>Ctl+G Ctl+P</code>) can be 
used to execute the PM with options that cannot be specified by using
the ordinary <i>Prove Step Or Module</i> command with appropriate preference 
settings.&nbsp;

Issuing this command raises a dialog with which you choose the PM options
from the following selections.&nbsp;

<h4>Launch in Toolbox Mode</h4>

This is the normal option.&nbsp;  It causes the PM to determine 
what proof(s) it checks just as it does for the ordinary
<i>Prove Step or Module</i> command.&nbsp;

Without it (or appropriate options provided in the
<i>Enter additional tlapm command-line arguments</i> field),
the PM will check the entire module and will uncolor all proof
steps. 

<h4>Chose prover(s) to use</h4>
You must choose one of these options:
<dl>
<dt>Use Isabelle only if necessary</dt>
<dd>Do not have Isabelle check an obligation that has
already been proved by another back-end prover.&nbsp;
This is the normal option.&nbsp; </dd>
<br></br>

<dt>No proving</dt>
<dd>Do not call any back-end prover.</dd>
<br></br>

<dt>Check Zenon proofs with Isabelle</dt>
<dd>Use Isabelle to check proofs of obligations produced
by Zenon.</dd>
<br></br>

<dt>Do not use Isabelle</dt>
<dd>The PM will use Zenon or any other backend prover it should 
except Isabelle.&nbsp;

It will not use Isabelle even if the proof specifies that an
Isabelle tactic should be used to check a proof.
</dd>
<dt></dt>


</dl>
<h4>Using previous results</h4>
You must choose one of these options:
<dl>
<dt>Use previous results</dt>
<dd>
Accept the results previously obtained by back-end provers.&nbsp;

This means that a back-end prover will not be called to prove
an obligation if it already succeeded or failed when trying to
prove the obligation.&nbsp;
 
This is the normal option.&nbsp;</dd>
<br></br>

<dt>Forget all previous results</dt>
<dd>Causes the PM to erase from its memory the
results of all previous attempts by back-end
provers to prove obligations.
</dd>
<br></br>

<dt>Forget currently selected previous results</dt>

<dd>Causes the PM to erase from its memory the
results of all previous attempts by back-end
provers to prove obligations of the currently-selected
proof(s).&nbsp;

If you think that the PM has gotten confused about 
the proof status of an obligation, use this option together with
the <i>No proving</i>
option to get it to forget the status and do nothing else. 

</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Paranoid checking</h4>

This tells the PM to call Isabelle to prove 
obligations that the PM believes are trivially true and don't need
to be proved.

<h4>Enter additional tlapm command-line arguments</h4>

Tlapm is the program that implements the Proof Manager.&nbsp;

Do not even think of using this field unless you know what
command-line options tlapm accepts.&nbsp;

The field allows you to write additional
options exactly 
the way they are written as command-line
options for tlapm.&nbsp;

These command-line options are appended to the ones generated by the
<i>Advanced Execution Preferences</i> and by the selections
made in the rest of the dialog.&nbsp;


If you are thinking about using this field,
you can probably figure out what those options are.&nbsp;

However, you will probably want to specify all the options yourself in 
this field.&nbsp;

To cause the preference page to generate no options, use the default
settings of the <i>Advanced Execution Preferences</i>: all fields left
blank.&nbsp;

To cause the rest of the <i>Launch Prover</i> dialog to generate no options,
select only &nbsp;<samp>Do not use Isabelle</samp>&nbsp; and
&nbsp;<samp>Use previous results</samp>&nbsp;.



<h3><a name="user-defined">User-Defined Color Predicates</a></h3>

<p>
The <i>Additional Preferences</i> subpage of the main <i>TLAPS</i>
preference page allows you to define color predicates.&nbsp; 

You can define almost any color predicate you might want.&nbsp; 

Here is a complete explanation of how.&nbsp;

Don't worry if you find the explanation hard to understand.&nbsp;

The Toolbox won't let you enter an illegal definition, and you
can experiment until you figure out how to write the definition
you want.


</p>
<p>
At any time, an obligation has a <i>state</i>.&nbsp; 
For the dummy obligation representing a missing proof or
the proof <code>OMITTED</code>,
its state 
is either <code>missing</code> or <code>omitted</code>.&nbsp; An ordinary proof
obligation's state consists of a status for each prover.&nbsp;
We consider there to be three provers: 
<ul>
 <li>Isabelle</li>

 <li>Other, representing Zenon, the Cooper algorithm, and
any SMT backend prover</li>
 <li>The PM itself, which is considered to prove
     obligations that it finds trivial.
 </li>
</ul> 

The possible statuses of these provers are: 

<ul> 

<li>Isabelle: <code>untried</code>, <code>proving</code>,
<code>proved</code>, <code>failed</code>, <code>stopped</code> </li>

<li>Other:     <code>untried</code>, <code>proving</code>, <code>proved</code>, <code>failed</code>, <code>stopped</code> </li>

<li>PM: <code>none</code>, <code>trivial</code> </li>

</ul>
The state of an ordinary obligation is written as a triple
such as <code>(proving</code>, <code>failed</code>, <code>none)</code>, 
where the value of the <i>i</i><sup>th</sup> element
is the obligation's proof status for the <i>i</i><sup>th</sup> prover.
</p>

<p>
A color predicate is specified by two things:
<ul>
 <li>A set OS of obligation states.</li>
 <li>Whether it is an <i>every</i> or a <i>some</i> predicate.</li>
</ul>
An <i>every</i> predicate is true of a proof iff (if and only if)
 the state of every obligation of the proof is in OS.&nbsp;
A <i>some</i> predicate is true of a proof iff
the state of at least one of the proof's obligations is
in OS.
</p>

<p>
A color predicate is specified by a string with the following syntax
<pre>
   &lt;color-predicate&gt; ::=  ["every" | "some"] &lt;state-set&gt;*

   &lt;state-set&gt; ::= "missing" | "omitted" 
                     | "(" &lt;statuses&gt; "," &lt;statuses&gt; "," &lt;statuses&gt; ")"

   &lt;statuses&gt; ::=  &lt;status&gt;* | "-" &lt;status&gt;+ 
</pre>

Each <code>&lt;state-set&gt;</code> specifies a set of states, and a
sequence of <code>&lt;state-set&gt;</code>s specifies their union.&nbsp;

The <code>&lt;state-set&gt;</code>s <code>"missing"</code> and <code>"omitted"</code>
specify the obvious singleton sets of dummy-obligation states.&nbsp;  

A <code>&lt;statuses&gt;</code> specifies a set of possible prover statuses
as a list, where <code>"-"</code>, means <i>all statuses
except</i> and the empty list means all possible statuses.&nbsp;

A triple of sequences of statuses specifies the set of all states in
which the proof status of the <i>i</i><sup>th</sup> prover is one of
the statuses in the <i>i</i><sup>th</sup> component of the
triple.&nbsp; 

An empty sequence of statuses is an abbreviation for all possible
statuses.&nbsp; For example, the <code>&lt;state-set&gt;</code>
<pre>
   (proving proved, untried, ) 
</pre>

is the set of all obligation states in which Isabelle's proof status
is either <code>proving</code> or <code>proved</code>, the Other
prover's status is <code>untried</code>, and the PM's prover status is either
<code>none</code> or <code>trivial</code>.&nbsp; 

We can write a color predicate that is always true as: <pre>
   every missing omitted ( , , )
</pre>
The color predicate
<pre>
   some
</pre>
is false for every proof.&nbsp;  The predicate
<pre>
   every omitted (proved, , ) (, proved, ) (, , trivial)
</pre>
is true iff every obligation is either omitted, is proved by Isabelle
or the Other prover, or is found trivial by the PM.&nbsp; The predicate
<pre>
  some (failed, - proved, none) (- proved, failed, none)
</pre> 

is true for a proof iff, for at least one of its obligations, either
Isabelle's status is <code>failed</code> and the Other prover's status
is not <code>proved</code>, or vice-versa, and the PM has not found it
to be trivial.&nbsp;
