<h2><a name="viewing">Viewing Proofs</a></h2>
<p> When you open in the module editor a module containing a theorem
wth a proof, you will see a &nbsp;<samp>(-)</samp>&nbsp; next to the
theorem and next to each step that has a subproof.&nbsp; To avoid
repeatedly saying <em>step or theorem</em>, we here take a
<em>step</em> to be either a theorem or a step of a theorem's
proof.&nbsp;

Clicking on the &nbsp;<samp>(-)</samp>&nbsp; next to a step hides the
step's proof and changes the &nbsp;<samp>(-)</samp>&nbsp; to a
&nbsp;<samp>(+)</samp>&nbsp;.

Clicking on the &nbsp;<samp>(+)</samp>&nbsp; undoes the effect of
clicking on the &nbsp;<samp>(-)</samp>&nbsp;.
</p>

Right-clicking on a step provides a menu with a section containing
the following commands for
hiding and revealing parts of the proof of the step at which the
cursor is positioned.&nbsp;  These commands can also be executed
with the indicated pair of keystrokes.&nbsp;

If you just type <samp>Ctl+G</samp> (the first keystroke) and wait
a second, you will see a list of all the commands telling you what
keystroke you should type next.

<p>

<dl>

<dt> <b>Show Current Subtree</b> &nbsp; &nbsp; <samp>Ctl+G Ctl+S</samp> </dt>
<dd> Reveals the proof of the step.</dd>
<p> </p>

<dt> <b>Hide Current Subtree</b> &nbsp; &nbsp; <samp>Ctl+G Ctl+H</samp> </dt>
<dd> Hides the proof of the step.</dd>
<p> </p>

<dt> <b>Show Children Only</b> &nbsp; &nbsp; <samp>Ctl+G Ctl+C</samp> </dt>
<dd> Reveals the top level of the step's proof.</dd>
<p> </p>

<dt> <b>Focus on Step</b> &nbsp; &nbsp; <samp>Ctl+G Ctl+F</samp> </dt>
<dd> Hides everything except the top level of the step's proof and
the siblings (steps at the same level as) of the step and
of every ancestor of that step in the proof.</dd>
</dl>

The following commands can be performed by right-clicking anywhere
in the module.

<dl>
<dt> <b>Show All Proofs</b> &nbsp; &nbsp; <samp>Ctl+G Ctl+A</samp> </dt>
<dd> Reveals the complete proof of every theorem in the module.</dd>
<p> </p>

<dt> <b>Hide All Proofs</b> &nbsp; &nbsp; <samp>Ctl+G Ctl+N</samp> </dt>
<dd> Hides the proof of every theorem in the module.</dd>
</dl>
The <em>Focus on Step</em> command performed outside a proof
is equivalent to <em>Hide All Proofs</em>

<h2><a name="editing">Editing Proofs</a></h2>

There are two commands especially for editing proofs:
<dl>
<dt><b>Decompose Proof</b> &nbsp; &nbsp; <samp>Ctl+G Ctl+D</samp> </dt>
<dd> To use this command, put the cursor in a theorem or proof step that
has either no proof or else a leaf proof (a <code>BY</code> or <code>OBVIOUS</code>
proof) that TLAPS can't verify.&nbsp;  This command raises a dialog window that allows
you to decompose the proof of the theorem or step into simpler steps.&nbsp;
The dialog contains a 
   <IMG SRC=../gettingstarted/question-mark.gif align=bottom>
button that raises <a href="decompose.html">this help page</a>, which explains
what you can do with this dialog.

</dd>
<dt><b>Renumber Proof</b> &nbsp; &nbsp; <samp>Ctl+G Ctl+R</samp> </dt>
<dd>
A proof step is either <i>named</i> or <i>unnamed</i>.&nbsp;  

An unnamed step begins with just a level number, like <code><4></code>.&nbsp;

A named step begins with a level number and a name, like <code><4>7</code>
or <code><4>xy2</code> (optionally followed by a period).&nbsp;

Putting the cursor on a proof step and executing the <i>Renumber Proof</i>
command causes all the named top-level steps of its proof to be renamed with
consecutive numbers, like <code><4>1</code>, <code><4>2</code>, etc.
</dd>
</dl>
The Toolbox editor's 
<a href="../spec/editing-modules.html#block-selection">block-selection
mode</a> can help in formatting proofs.&nbsp;

We would like to create additional editor commands to make it easier to write
and edit proofs, but we don't know what commands would be useful.&nbsp;  

Please tell us what commands <i>you</i> would like.&nbsp;
