<h1>Pretty-Printing Modules</h1>

 <P> 
You can create and view a pretty-printed 
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/adobepdf.html"  target="_blank">PDF (Portable
Document Format)</a> version of a module.&nbsp;  Just view the module
in a module editor and select&nbsp; <samp>File/Produce PDF Version</samp>.&nbsp;  However,
to do this, you must have the&nbsp; <samp>pdflatex</samp>&nbsp; program installed.&nbsp;
This program is distributed with most versions of&nbsp; 
<a href="http://www.latex-project.org/"  target="_blank"><samp>LaTeX</samp></a>&nbsp;
and&nbsp; <a href="http://www.tug.org/"  target="_blank"><samp>TeX</samp></a>.&nbsp;  A popular source
of TeX for PCs is&nbsp; <samp><a href="http://www.miktex.org/"  target="_blank">MiKTeX</a></samp>.
 </P>

<p>The Toolbox runs&nbsp; <samp>pdflatex</samp>&nbsp; to produce a PDF file with the
same name as the module, but with the extension&nbsp; <code>.pdf</code>.&nbsp;  It displays this
file in a separate page of the module editor, using your computer's default browser
to display the PDF file.&nbsp;  (If the browser doesn't have a plug-in that displays PDF files,
you can 
<a href="http://get.adobe.com/reader/otherversions/"  target="_blank">find one on the web.</a>)&nbsp;

You can switch between the editable
ASCII version of the module and the PDF version by clicking on the appropriate
tab in the lower-left corner.&nbsp;

Changes made to the module are not automatically made to the PDF version.&nbsp;
To see them, you must create the PDF version again.
</p>

<p>There are things you can do to help the pretty printer
produce better output.  They are described in the  
<a href="help-print.html">Helping the Pretty-Printer</a>
help page.
</p>

<h3>Preferences</h3>

<p> 
The&nbsp; <samp>PDF Viewer Preferences</samp>&nbsp; page on 
the&nbsp; <samp>File/Preferences</samp>&nbsp; menu provides the following options:
<h4>Shade comments</h4>
Comments are shaded in gray.&nbsp;  This is the default.&nbsp;  The darkness of the shading is specified
by the <b>Specify gray level</b> option.&nbsp;  This must be a number between
0.0 (completely black) and 1.0 (no shading).&nbsp;  The default is 0.85.

<h4>Number lines</h4>

Number lines in the PDF output.&nbsp;  (This is independent of the line-numbering option for
the module editor.)&nbsp;  The default is unnumbered

<h4>Specify pdflatex command</h4>

This is the command with which the Toolbox calls&nbsp; <samp>pdflatex</samp>&nbsp;
to produce the pretty-printed version.&nbsp;  The default value&nbsp; <samp>pdflatex</samp>&nbsp;
should work if the&nbsp; <samp>pdflatex</samp>&nbsp; program is installed on your
computer.&nbsp;  However, if it is not properly installed, you may have to prefix it with the path name
of the program's directory.

<h4>Specify gray level</h4>

See the <b>Shade comments</b> option above.
