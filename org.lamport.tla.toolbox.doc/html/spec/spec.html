<h1>Managing Your Specifications</h1>

 <P> 
If you are using the Toolbox, you should have some knowledge of
the TLA+ specification language.&nbsp;  (See the <a href="../gettingstarted/resources.html">
TLA+ Resources</a> help page for information on how to acquire this knowledge.).&nbsp;
You should therefore have a basic understanding of what a TLA+ specification is.&nbsp;
We usually use the term <em>spec</em> instead of <em>specification</em>.
</P>
<p>The Toolbox allows you to create, edit, and check one spec at a time.&nbsp;
See the subtopics listed below to find out how to create, modify,
view, and parse your spec.&nbsp;
</P>

 <p> 
Running the <A href="../model/model.html">TLC Model Checker</A> on a spec can
sometimes create a lot of data associated with the spec.&nbsp;

See the <A href="../gettingstarted/tla-preferences.html">TLA+ Preferences</A>
help page to learn how to find out how much storage your spec is using and
what to do if it is using too much.  
 </p>

<p>
You may want to use the same modules in different specs--for example, ones that define
data structures that you want to re-use.&nbsp;  

The best way to do that is to put those modules in one or more <em>library folders</em>.
See the <A href="../gettingstarted/tla-preferences.html">TLA+ Preferences</A>
help page.
</p>

 <p>
You can run multiple instances of the Toolbox to work on different
specifications concurrently.&nbsp; 

Do not open the same specification in two different instances of the Toolbox
at the same time.
