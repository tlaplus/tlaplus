<h1>Parsing</h1>

<p>
The Toolbox parses a spec upon opening it.&nbsp;  The parse status of the currently 
open spec is shown in the lower right-hand
corner of the Toolbox window.&nbsp;  The status is either:&nbsp; <samp>Parsed</samp>, 
meaning it has no parsing
errors;&nbsp; <samp>Unparsed</samp>, meaning that the spec had no errors the last time
 it was parsed, but that
one of its files has since been modified and saved;&nbsp; or <samp>Error</samp>, 
meaning that an error
was found the last time it was parsed.
</p>

<p>
Clicking&nbsp; <samp>File/Parse Spec</samp>&nbsp;  parses the 
spec.&nbsp;  Clicking&nbsp; <samp>File/Parse Module</samp>&nbsp; parses the 
currently selected module, which 
is the one in the most recently selected module editor.&nbsp;  
Parsing the spec is equivalent to parsing its root module.&nbsp; 
Unless your spec is <font size=+1>VERY BIG</font>, you will want to parse whenever 
a module is saved.&nbsp;
See the parsing preferences listed below for how to do this.</p>

<p>
If there is a parsing error, the Toolbox pops up a Parsing Errors view.&nbsp;  For most errors, clicking on
the error takes you to its location in a module editor.&nbsp;  The Toolbox also marks the locations of the 
errors in the module editor (or editors).&nbsp;  There is a preference, described below, that controls
whether or not the Parsing Errors view 
automatically pops up.&nbsp;  If you set it not to pop up, you can open the view from the 
Toolbox's&nbsp; <samp>Window</samp>&nbsp; menu.
</p>

<h2>Parsing Preferences</h2>

<h3>Re-parse module on save</h3>

<p>
Causes a module to be reparsed when you save it from the module editor.&nbsp;  It is the default.
</p>

<h3>Re-parse specification on spec module save</h3>

<p>

Causes the entire spec to be reparsed when you save a module, if that module is part
of the spec.&nbsp;  More precisely, the spec is reparsed if the Toolbox found the module to be part of the 
spec when the spec was
last parsed.&nbsp;  This option has no effect unless the <b>Re-parse module on save</b> option is chosen.&nbsp;
It is the default.
</p>

<h3>Always pop up Parsing Errors view</h3>

<p>
It is the default.
