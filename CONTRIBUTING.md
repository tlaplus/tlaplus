We welcome contributions from volunteers. A number of [improvements we'd like to see implemented](https://github.com/tlaplus/tlaplus/blob/master/general/docs/contributions.md) are listed at [general/docs/contributions.md](https://github.com/tlaplus/tlaplus/blob/master/general/docs/contributions.md) in addition to the [issues tagged with "helpwanted"](https://github.com/tlaplus/tlaplus/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22). But we're happy to consider anything you'd like to contribute. However, some parts of the tlaplus repository follow a very strict contribution policy. So before you start working on anything, please [discuss with us](https://github.com/tlaplus/tlaplus/issues) what you want to do. You can do that on the [issues page](https://github.com/tlaplus/tlaplus/issues). We do not want to reject your 1k LOC patch because the actual change is not considered sensible by us.

 

Except for [TLAPS](https://tla.msr-inria.inria.fr/tlaps/content/Home.html), the TLA<sup>+</sup> tools are maintained in Eclipse. [For instructions on how to setup the Eclipse IDE, please go to general/ide/README.md.](https://github.com/tlaplus/tlaplus/tree/master/general/ide).
