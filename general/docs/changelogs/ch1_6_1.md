### Changelog
The high level changelog is available at http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/toolbox.html#release. The [1.6.1 milestone](https://github.com/tlaplus/tlaplus/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A1.6.1+is%3Aclosed) lists all completed issues.


### Additional noteworthy changes

#### TLC
* Annotation-based loading of TLC module overrides for TLA+ operators. eb42f9ed462782c1577ec7433a993b770959437e

#### Toolbox

##### Preferences
* The "Show Evaluate Constant Expression in its own tab" preference has been moved from `TLA+ Preferences → TLC Model Checker` to `TLA+ Preferences → Model Editor`
* The `TLA+ Preferences → TLAPS` preference subtree has been altered:
 * the previous page at `TLA+ Preferences → TLAPS` is now at `TLA+ Preferences → TLAPS → Color Predicates`.
 * The page previously at `TLA+ Preferences → TLAPS → Additional Preferences` is now renamed to `TLA+ Preferences → TLAPS → Other Preferences`.
 * Non-color-predicate-related preferences from `TLA+ Preferences → TLAPS → Additional Preferences` have been moved into `TLA+ Preferences → TLAPS`.
 * `TLA+ Preferences → TLAPS` now also features the ability to set a file system location for the `tlapm` executable should the Toolbox not be able to find it.
* On macOS, you can now set the preference to have the operating system open PDFs with your default PDF viewer via `TLA+ Preferences → PDF Viewer`

##### Spec Editor
* The spec editor now allows the collapsing of block comments, PlusCal code, and the TLA+ translation of PlusCal code. The first line of each of these types of runs should feature a minus icon in the line number gutter. Clicking on this icon will collapse the run; while in a collapsed state, holding the mouse over the, now: plus, icon will show the collapsed text as a tooltip.
 * Please review the help page for the PlusCal translator in the Toolbox for guidance
 as to how the comment block surround the PlusCal algorithm should be written.
 * The preferences pane found at `TLA+ Preferences → Module Editor` allows for the setting of the default folding preferences (e.g 'always fold block comments when opening a specification in the editor.')
* The translation of PlusCal code now generates a checksum of this code and the resulting TLA+ code; this checksum is calculated again when a model is executed and if it has changed, either a warning dialog will be displayed (if executed via the Toolbox) or a log warning will be emitted (if TLC is executed on the command line.)
* If attempting to generate a PDF of a spec fails because the `pdflatex` executable could not be found, a more informative warning dialog is now displayed for the user, including a way to directly open the Toolbox preference page specifying executable location.

##### Model Editor
* The style of the display of definitions in the "Definition Override" section in the Spec Options tab can be defined in the `TLA+ Preferences → Model Editor` preferences. There are two styles currently; given a `Definition` from a `Module Name` referenced in the primary spec like `InstanceName == INSTANCE ModuleName WITH ...`, then the two available styles are:
 * `Definition [Module Name]`
 * `InstanceName!Definition`
* The Initial predicate / Next-state text areas were no longer interpreting a TAB as 'advance focus' due to a regression introduced when we moved to multi-line support for these text areas in 1.6.0. Both text areas now interpret a TAB as a focus advance; a TAB in the 'Init:' text area moves focus to the 'Next:' text area and a TAB in that text area advances the focus to the 'What is the model?' section.

##### Spec Explorer
* Right-clicking on model snapshots was incorrectly presenting the choice to rename the snapshot; this has been corrected.
* Renaming specifications now correctly cleans up after itself [and should no longer prevent models from being opened.](https://github.com/tlaplus/tlaplus/issues/339)
* Previously, opening a spec while the current spec had a dirty editor open, and to which the user chose to `Cancel` the offer to save the dirtied editor, resulted in the Toolbox continuing to open the new spec. This has been fixed - the opening process is halted and the original spec remains open.

##### Trace Explorer
* The Error-Trace can now be filtered to omit one or more variables and/or expressions. Clicking on the filter icon, when filtering is not on, will display a dialog allowing the user to select from the set of variables and expressions found in the trace; alternatively, the user may ALT-click on a variable or expression in the Error-Trace tree view which will then omit that variable or expression. ([Screencast](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tlaplus/tlaplus/master/general/docs/changelogs/screencasts/error-trace-filtering.gif))
* [Allow Trace-Explorer to extend additional TLA+ modules](https://github.com/tlaplus/tlaplus/issues/342) ([Screencast](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tlaplus/tlaplus/master/general/docs/changelogs/screencasts/ExtendModulesForTraceExplorer.gif))
* Export Error-Trace to system's clipboard ([Screencast](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tlaplus/tlaplus/master/general/docs/changelogs/screencasts/ExportErrorTrace.gif))
* Also provided in the Error-Trace filtering dialog is the ability to hide variables whose values have not changed. For a variable that has changed at sometime during the trace, it may be displayed in either only the frames in which its value has changed, or in every frame of the trace. ([Screencast](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tlaplus/tlaplus/master/general/docs/changelogs/screencasts/show_hide_changed_variables.gif))
* Model checking can now be started using any given frame shown in the Error-Trace as the state constraint. Right-clicking on any location row will display a context menu giving the user the opportunity to run the model checking starting at that state. ([Screencast](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tlaplus/tlaplus/master/general/docs/changelogs/screencasts/model_check_from_error_trace_state.gif))

### Running checking in Ad Hoc mode
* We have ended support for launching workers via JNLP; more information can be found on the master server's web page when running in this mode (e.g http://localhost:10996)

### A note to macOS users
Startup on macOS version 10.14 (Mojave) will fail with "TLA+ Toolbox can't be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software.".  Please make sure to follow the instructions outlined in [GitHub issue #320](https://github.com/tlaplus/tlaplus/issues/320) to address this problem.
