TO START SVC-LAMPORT-7 AS A TESTBED
  https://tla.msr-inria.inria.fr/build/computer/svc/
  log in as lamport/lamportpassword
  Start the slave.
  
  Note: To set up a new machine to replace SVC-LAMPORT-7,
        must install Java jdk and add the environment variable JAVA_HOME 
        and set it to something like C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_26


TO PREPARE THE ZIP FILES FOR THE TOOLBOX RELEASE

Notes: 0. Run Ant on tlatools/src/customBuild.xml

       1. To get tlatools.jar file copied to the right place for the distributed version of TLC, 
          after running Ant, run "mvn install" in the directory
      
            C:\lamport\tla\newtools\tla2-inria-workspace\tla2-inria\org.lamport.tla.toolbox.jnlp
            
       2. If maven doesn't produce a good build, try running `mvn clean' before
          running `mvn install'
          
       3. The file .../newtools/tla2-inria/pom.xml is not automatically updated
          by SVN inside Eclipse, and must be updated by running 'svn up pom.xml'
          in a Cygwin shell.  Running `svn up' in a Cygwin shell might not be a bad
          idea, because it seems to update some things that Eclipse doesn't.

Step 1: Get the right version numbers to appear:


In org.lamport.tla.toolbox.product.standalone 
  plugin.xml : line 32 (the "aboutText" property), update date and version 
               and other stuff that appears in the Help/About window.  

  standalone.product: 
    As of 24 Jun 2011, standalone.product has moved to:
    org.lamport.tla.toolbox.product.product.product
     Branding tab: update date and version (This is used in Help > About and used to
        create zip file names.)
     Overview: update version.  (I don't know if this is used anywhere.)


In org.lamport.tla.toolbox/welcome/welcomeView.html
   Update date and version
   
In org.lamport.tla.toolbox.doc/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF, update the version (major.minor.micro).
But do _not_ replace the last (".qualifier") segment. It is automatically replaced by the build.

Also, the version number in the pom.xml file in the same directory (and only in the same 
directory???) has to be made the same (but leave the "-SNAPSHOT" unchanged).  Note that 
explicitly replacing ".qualifier" with e.g. ".f" breaks the build with:

"Failed to execute goal org.eclipse.tycho:tycho-packaging-plugin:0.14.0-SNAPSHOT:validate-version 
(default-validate-version) on project org.lamport.tla.toolbox.doc: OSGi version 1.4.3.f must have .qualifier qualifier for SNAPSHOT builds"

(If one absolutely has to set the ".qualifier" segment explicitly, do not forget to update 
the version (not parent version!) org.lamport.tla.toolbox.doc/pom.xml
correspondingly. It has to match the MANIFEST.MF version verbatim.  However, 3 levels of version numbers
are enough and we should abandon the .a, .b, ...)

OBSOLETE:
In toolbox.product.standalone/intro/root.xhtml: 
  update version information.

Step 2: Build the .zip files:
Method 1: 
Note: org.lamport.tla.toolbox.product.product.product
       before June 2011 was named
   org.lamport.tla.toolbox.product.standalone.product
   
  Go to the Overview tab of org.lamport.tla.toolbox.product.product.product   
  Synchronize and use Eclipse Product export wizard
  In the first menu, give
    Product Configuration: 
      Configuration:
        /org.lamport.tla.toolbox.product.product/org.lamport.tla.toolbox.product.product.product
      Root directory: toolbox
    Synchronization:
      Synchronize before exporting
    Destination:
      Archive file:
        c:\lamport\tla\toolbox-release\toolbox-i.j.k  or
        c:\users\lamport\tla\toolbox-release\toolbox-i.j.k on svc-lamport-4
        
    Export Options
      Generate metadata repository
      Export for muliple platforms
      Allow for binary cycles in target platform
  In Cross-platform export menu, select
    linux (gtk/x86 & x86_64)
    macosx (cocoa/x86 & x86_64
    win32 (win32/x86 & x86_64)

 Hitting Finish then puts the zip files into:
     c:\users\lamport\tla\toolbox-release
 The repository/ directory in c:\users\lamport\tla\ contains the content for the update site (p2)

Method 2. Using Maven
 NOTE:  ~/tla/newtools/tla2-inria-workspace/tla2-inria has been changed to
      ~/tla/newtools/tla-workspace on SVC-LAMPORT-2 and to ~/tla/newtools/tla2-workspace
      on SVC-LAMPORT-1.
  Run svn update on  pom.xml in ~/tla/newtools/tla2-inria-workspace/tla2-inria. 
  Set the version number in ...product.product/pom.xml.
  (The target platforms to build for are specified in tla2-inria/pom.xml.  This file also specifies
   what version of the Eclipse libraries to build with.)
  In a Cygwin shell, 
   - cd to ~/tla/newtools/tla2-inria-workspace/tla2-inria
   - run:  mvn install
  This might fail because the right versions of things aren't installed.
    It it does, try running "mvn clean" first.
  Running "mvn install" runs tests, which could fail--especially if
     I'm using the machine while it's running the tests.  I should probably
     run mvn on a window that I'm not using, but mouse movements could
     probably still cause the tests to fail.  If I want to run the tests,
     I probably shouldn't do anything else at the same time.
  To not run the tests, instead run
     mvn install -Dmaven.test.skip=true
  To have it do the tests but continue if it fails, run
     mvn install -Dmaven.test.failure.ignore=true
    However, failure of a test seems capable of hanging up Maven.
  The .zip files are in
       C:\lamport\tla\newtools\tla-workspace\org.lamport.tla.toolbox.product.product\target\products
  They also appear with weird names in:
       C:\Users\lamport\.m2\repository\tlatoolbox\org.lamport.tla.toolbox.product.product\version-number-SNAPSHOT
       This will keep accumulating new versions.  To delete an old version, delete the
          C:\Users\lamport\.m2\repository\tlatoolbox\
       directory.

Method 3. Using tla.msr-inria.inria.fr
  - In browser, goto https://tla.msr-inria.inria.fr/build
  - login
  - before making a release, check that there are no problems by checking
    in all changes, and going to M-HEAD-Toolbox.product.standalone
    IF THERE IS A FAILURE, click on the "default" button under "Configurations"
    (which will add "/os=master" to the URL), then
    click on the appropriate version, then click on "Console Output" (not "raw").
    The error may appear in red at the bottom.
  - to make a new release: click on the button to the right of
       Release-HEAD-Toolbox.product.standalone  
       This isn't released publicly until I do the release step, below
       
  - to get the release zip files, 
       * To get the last promoted (publicly available) release, go to: 
            - goto https://tla.msr-inria.inria.fr/build
            - click on Release-HEAD-Toolbox.product.standalone 
            - click on "Latest product zips" to get the Toolbox zips
              click on "TLA+ distribution zip" to get to the stand-alone 
                TLA tools release zip file, which is in tla.zip.
       * To get the last created (but not necessarily promoted) release, go to:
            https://tla.msr-inria.inria.fr/tlatoolbox/staged
              /products = toolbox zip files
              /dist = tools distribution
         an alternative is:
               https://tla.msr-inria.inria.fr/build/job/M-HEAD-Toolbox.product.standalone/os=master/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/org.lamport.tla.toolbox.product.product/target/
               * click on products
               * you can get the 6 Toolbox zip files from /products and tla.zip from /dist
     Another alternate way to get to the https://...target/ page:
      On https://tla.msr-inria.inria.fr/build
       1. click on Release-HEAD-Toolbox.product.standalone 
       2. click on Latest product zips
      to get to the stand-alone TLA tools release zip file, in step 2
      click on "TLA+ distribution zip".  The release is in tla.zip.
  - To release this:
     Click on Release-HEAD-Toolbox.product.standalone (direct link https://tla.msr-inria.inria.fr/build/job/Release-HEAD-Toolbox.product.standalone/)
     Click on most recent build in build history.
     Click on Promotion Status.
     Click on Approve.
     
  Note: The Toolbox tries to update itself by looking for the files at  lamport.org/tlatoolbox/toolboxUpdate/.
        This is redirected to the right place by putting in my lamport.org/ top-level directory a file named .htaccess containing
        the line
                  Redirect /tlatoolbox http://tla.msr-inria.inria.fr/tlatoolbox
    

TO PREPARE THE STAND-ALONE TLA TOOLS RELEASE ZIP FILE (IN 
Methods 1 and 2)
  Run the Ant default-release option.  This will put the release in
     C:\lamport\tla\newtools\tla2-inria\tlatools\dist\tla.zip

TO GENERATE THE RELEASE:
  In Feb 2013, the following became obsolete.  Perhaps I can do it
  by going to 
  
     https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/MSRrelease/Pages/default.aspx
     
  probably I will need help.  In Feb 2013, I was helped by 
  John Ransier (Aditi Technologies Private LTD) <v-jorans@microsoft.com>.
