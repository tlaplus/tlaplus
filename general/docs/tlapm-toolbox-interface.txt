---------------------- Toolbox-TLAPM interface ----------------------------

************ What the toolbox sends to TLAPM ************

--toolbox <bl> <el> [options] FILE

<bl> and <el> are both integers that give the begin line and end line of the part of the 
file to be considered by the prover. If the arguments are both equal to 0, the entire module 
will be considered.


########## Options:

### Proving options:

--method        changes the default method for proving 
		(the default is zenon with 10 second time-out and isabelle auto fallback)
		        According to the documentation obtained with --meth help, the
		        possible values are:		      
                   auto      Isabelle's "auto" tactic (requires -C)
                   blast     Isabelle's "blast" tactic (requires -C)
                   force     Isabelle's "force" tactic (requires -C)
                   fail      Fake method that always fails
                   sorry     Fake method that accepts all proofs (use with caution!)

--solver        which smt solver to use

--paranoid      asks isabelle to check trivial obligations
                Experimentation suggests that this is a no-op if --noproving
                is chosen.

--isaprove      sends obligations to isabelle to be proved as soon as zenon fails 
		or when isabelle is called by a pragma.

--noproving     does not send any obligations to backends. Checks if an obligation is 
		trivial or not and considers previous results in the fingerprint files. 
		If an obligation is not trivial and does not appear in the fingerprints 
		file, then the only message sent to the toolbox has a status "to be proved".

--threads       <num> num is an integer giving the number of worker backend threads used. 
		Default is the number of cores.

-C              sends all obligations to isabelle for checking except trivial obligations 
		(if --paranoid is not called), already checked obligations, and obligations 
		on which isabelle has already failed or succeeded.

NOTE: If neither --isaprove nor --noproving (or -N) nor -C is specified, then tlapm will
      use any prover (such as Zenon or the Cooper algorithm or an SMT solver) except
      Isabelle--even if an Isabelle tactic is explicitly specified by a proof.

### Display options:

--wait <t>      t is an integer. After sending an obligation to a backend, the pm waits 
		t seconds. If the backend has not finished on that obligation after those 
		t seconds, the pm sends an obligation message with status "being proved" 
		to the toolbox for that obligation. The default value is 3.


### Fingerprint options:

--cleanfp       erase the fingerprint file before processing the module. Adds new fingerprints.

--nofp          erase fingerprints of obligations considered by the present launch of 
		the toolbox (i.e. located between bl and el). Adds new fingerprints.

--nofpl b e     erase fingerprints of obligations both (considered by the present launch of 
		the toolbox) and (located between lines b and e). Adds new fingerprints.

--fpdir <dir>   sets to dir the directory from which the fingerprints file is loaded and to 
		which it is saved. (accepts both complete and relative pathnames)

--safefp        checks isabelle and zenon versions before loading fingerprints. Only uses 
		fingerprints whose zenon and isabelle versions equal the zenon and isabelle 
		versions currently used by tlapm.



### Other options (not yet used by the toolbox):

 --help                 show this help message and exit
  --version              show version number and exit
  --verbose              produce verbose messages
  -v                     (synonym for --verbose)

  --where                show location of standard library and exit
  --config               show configuration and exit
  --summary              show summary of theorems (implies -N and not -C)
                         experimentation shows that it prints the number
                         of obligations and the number and locations of
                         missing and omitted obligations.
  --timing               show runtime statistics

  -I <dir>               add <dir> to search path
  -d <dir>               send generated output to <dir>

  -k                     keep going on backend failures
  -N                     do not run any backend verifiers      
                         similar to --noproving, but experimentation shows that, when
                         used with --toolbox, --noproving generates status reports based
                         on fingerprints while -N does not.

  --solver <solver>      set SMT solver to <solver>


  --trust {[-]<backend>} enable/disable trust on backends (see --trust list)
  --noflatten            do not flatten obligations
  --nonormal             do not normalize obligations before printing
  --debug {[-]<flag>}    enable/disable debugging flags




######### While proving:

While tlapm is running, the Toolbox can send the following two strings to the tlapm:

1.) "kill\n" - this tells the pm to stop all backends and kill itself.
2.) "stop <id>\n" - this tells the pm to stop processing the obligation with id <id>.



************ What TLAPM sends to the Toolbox ************ 

Each message comes in the following form:
@!!BEGIN
@!!type:<type>
...
@!!END

Obligation Status Messages:

@!!BEGIN
@!!type:obligation
@!!id:<id>
@!!loc:<loc>
@!!status:<status>
@!!prover:<prover>
@!!method:<method>
@!!already:<alreadyProcessed>
@!!obl:<obligation-string>
@!!END


######### Fields:

<id> 		is a integer that is unique for that obligation for that run of the tlapm.

<loc>   	is a string giving the location of the obligation. 
		It takes the form <beginLine>:<beginColumn>:<endLine>:<endColumn>

<status> 	can be "to be proved" | "proved" | "failed" | "trivial" | "being proved" | "interrupted"

<prover> 	optional field. This field gives the prover on which the obligation has <status>. T
		his field does not appear iff <status> is "to be proved".

<method> 	optional field. This field gives the method used by <prover> to produce <status>. 
		This field is not sent iff <status> is "to be proved" or "trivial".

<alreadyProcessed> 	optional field. It appears iff <status> is not "to be proved" or "being proved". 
			It is "true" iff the result comes from the fingerprints file. It is "false" otherwise.

<obligation-string> 	optional field. It appears iff <status> is "failed" or "being proved" or "interrupted". 
			It gives the pretty printed string of the obligation.


######### Behavior:

For every obligation between the begin line and end line passed to the prover, the tlapm will return an 
obligation status message with status "to be proved". All such messages will be sent before any other 
obligation status messages are sent and before the obligation count message is sent.

The obligation count message gives the total number of obligations being considered by the tlapm. 
This number is equal to the number of obligation status message with status "to be proved". 
It takes the following form where <num> is the total number of obligations:

@!!BEGIN
@!!type:obligationsnumber
@!!count:<num>
@!!END

After the obligation count message has been sent, obligation status messages are sent as obligations are processed. 
The following specifies which statuses can be sent for which provers:

1.) <prover> is "tlapm"
     <status> = "trivial" | "proved" | "failed"
     The statuses "proved" and "failed" can only be sent for tlapm if the method is "cooper".
2.) <prover> is not "tlapm"
     <status> = "proved" | "failed" | "being proved" | "interrupted"

The status "being proved" is sent iff the prover has been working on the obligation for at least 3 seconds 
(or t seconds if the option --wait <t>) is called.

The status "interrupted" is sent if an individual obligation is stopped by sending the stop string.


### Warning Messages:

@!!BEGIN
@!!type:warning
@!!msg:<message>
@!!END

These messages report potentially bad behavior that should probably be shown to the user. 
The PM is not stopped.
Examples:

1.) bad fingerprints zenon version - zenon fingerprints not loaded 
2.) bad fingerprints isabelle version - isabelle fingerprints not loaded 
3.) bad fingerprints format - not loaded  (moved to ./TLA_<moduleName>.fp.corrupted)
3.) Location (of the problematic obligation). TLAPM does not handle yet (real numbers, temporal logic, etc...)
4.) Location. Illegal HAVE, WITNESS, SELECT... (in that case, the PM is stopped).

### Error Messages:

@!!BEGIN
@!!type:error
@!!msg:<message>
@!!END

Used to report tlapm behavior that should be reported to the tlapm developer(s).
The PM is stopped.

Examples:

1.) Bug raised by the PM.


######### Exit codes

0 - successful completion
1 - error of the pm. Normally a module parsing error.
2 - problem reading command line arguments
255 - tlapm interrupted
