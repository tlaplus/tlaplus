FILES
-----
These are the source files for the TLATeX program.  The main program
is in TLA.java.  In addition to the .java and .class files, there are:

tlatex.sty : A style file used by the LaTeX output.

help.txt : A file with the help message.

info.txt : A file with a reasonably complete description of TLATeX.

words.all : 
  A list of common English words.  It was obtained by taking the
  lower-case words from a Linux list, and adding the following,
  which were inexplicably missing.

   a  may  I  TLA  miscellany

old : a directory of old versions.

POSSIBLE ENHANCEMENTS
---------------------
1. When formatting an individual comment, TLATeX keeps track of
   which identifiers appear in the comment as TLA tokens.  It
   turns ambiguous instances of those identifiers into TLA tokens
   only for identifiers that are not words.  Possibly do it
   even if they are words--or perhaps have a sublist of common
   words and do it only for uncommon words.

2. Introduce a mechanism for turning operators into TeX macros--for
   example, so Integral(a+b, c, d) gets typeset as 

      \int^{a+b}_{c} d

   This is nontrivial because it requires finding the arguments,
   which in turn requires counting parentheses and looking for commas
   and right-parens.  A simpler possibility is just replacing
   certain identifiers by symbols--e.g., alpha -> \alpha.

   The specification of such replacements would be in the prolog or
   epilog, so we'd have to introduce some notation for identifying
   pro/epilog lines as TLATeX commands.  (This notation should generalize
   to arbitrary tools.)



BUGS 
----
Here are the known bugs in TLATeX:

1. If a ' in a comment is immediately followed by a character, as in

       `token'.

   then TLATeX inserts a spurious space before the ".".  Search
   for "LEFT_SQUOTE:" in TokenizeComment.java to see how to fix this.  
   But... a similar problem occurs with `^ ... ^' text, since the `^ 
   and ^' effectively act as spaces for determining whether to add space
   between adjacent tokens.  

   The same problem also occurs with a `~ ... ~' term, but in that case, 
   there may be no solution because the entire term has to be disappeared.

   Some uniform approach to handling this is called for.  It seems like
   the best approach is to try to increase the size of an immediately 
   following token by a ` or `^, and of an immediately  preceding token 
   by the ' or ^'.  This requires adding an explicit width field to
   a CToken object, or something equivalent.

2. The record component foo.WF_foo will be printed as

      foo.WF
            foo

   Fixing this unlikely problem requires fixing the lexing algorithm
   in TokenizeSpec.java.

Revision History
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Version 0.95 of 11 November 2001 
 - Modified FindAlignments to do InfixArg alignment only if the
   symbol to the left is an infix operator.
 - Modified LaTeXOutput.InnerWriteLaTeXFile to end a multiline
   comment with a comment line that is below-aligned with a 
   non-comment line.  (Previously, that case had been considered
   an error.)
 - Fixed the problem of TLATeX hanging if latex or dvips produced
   a lot of output by:
    * Adding classes ExecuteCommand and GobbleOutput
    * Modifying TLA.MakePSFile and LaTeXOutput.RunLatex to call 
      ExecuteCommand.
