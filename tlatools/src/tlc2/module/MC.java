/*
 * The Toolbox generates an MC.tla file upon TLC startup which extends the actual
 * specification being verified. Additionally, to evaluate any constant expression,
 * MC.tla also extends TLC.tla to use the PrintT operator defined in TLC.tla 
 * (and its module override tlc2.module.TLC):
 * "ASSUME PrintT(...)"
 * 
 * Extending TLC.tla in MC.tla can cause a name clash if the actual specification
 * does *not* extend TLC and happens to declare an operator colliding with one 
 * in TLC.tla (e.g. "Permutations", "SortSeq", ...).
 * 
 * To resolve this name clash, the Toolbox no longer extends TLC.tla in MC.tla but
 * instead generates a LOCAL declaration of PrintT:
 * "LOCAL PrintT(out) == TRUE
 *  ASSUME PrintT(...)"
 * 
 * TLC.tla's PrintT is override by the tlc2.module.TLC#PrintT module override.
 * Thus, the LOCAL construct above only resolves the name clash at the SANY level,
 * but produces no output. This class effectively associates MC.tla's PrintT with
 * tlc2.module.TLC#PrintT.
 *
