Eclipse-based build process
===============================================================================     
  1 SVN
    To initialize:
      Switch to "SVN Repository Exploring" perspective
      Right-click in "SVN Repositories" View
      Select "New" repository
      Add Repository URL (svn://svc-lamport-2/tla)
    To check-out:
      Browse in SVN repository to "trunk/tlatools"
      Right-click on the "trunk/tlatools" node
      Select "Checkout..."
      Hit Finish
    To commit, synchronize, revert, ... : select the actions from the pop-up
    menu accessed by the right-click on the corresponding node in "Project 
    Explorer" or "Navigator"
    
    
  2 Ant
    To initialize:
      Open "Ant" View
      Add the build file "tlatools/customBuild.xml"

  2 Ant
    To build:
      Change to project directory (tlatools)
      Run "ant target-name" from the command name
        "ant" - executes the run with default target and is equivalent to 
        "ant default"     
      Result: at the end of the build the BUILD SUCCESSFULL should appear
