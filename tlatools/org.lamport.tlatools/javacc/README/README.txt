The lexer code for SANY is produced by running JavaCC version 4.0 on the file tla+.jj 
and then making some hand modifications of the output. 

The file javacc-tutorial.pdf contains documentation for JavaCC, which I believe was
written for version 4.0.

The files method.txt and methods-sany1.txt contain instructions for making the
necessary modifications, along with miscellaneous documentation of the SANY code.

The last modifications of those files seem to have been made on:

   methods.txt       - 5 October 2009
   methods-sany1.txt - 15 March 2007
