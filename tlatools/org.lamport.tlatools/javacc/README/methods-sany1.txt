Note: There are almost identical copies of the files Token.java and
TokenMgrError.java in both the parser/ and configuration/ directories.
Both need to be there to compile correctly.  Clearly, something is
wrong here.

tlasany/drivers directory
-----------------
FrontEndException.java
  Simple extension to Exception to create an exception specific to the FrontEnd

InitException.java
  Simple extension to Exception to create an exception specific to the FrontEnd

SemanticException.java
  Simple extension to Exception to create an exception specific to the FrontEnd

SANY.java
   static SANYmain
     The main driver, called by tlasany/SANY.java.  It handles
     the command line and calles frontEndMain.
   static frontEndMain
     The real main driver, called by SANYmain.
   static frontEndInitialize
     [called from] frontEndMain
     initializes Configuration, Context, level data.
     throws InitException in case of problems.
   static frontEndParse
     [called from] frontEndMain
     loads and parse the spec file.
     uses SpecObj.loadSpec
   static frontEndSemanticAnalysis
     [called from] frontEndMain
     Coming out of parsing, we have all the modules required to analyse 
     the file from the SpecObj. They are organized in a vector, ordered 
     from modules with no dependencies to modules with most dependencies.
     Semantic analysis is done incrementally, with the context of each 
     module stored in a gobal table for easy retrieval.

==================================================================
tlasany/parser directory
-----------------------

This directory contains classes implementing the parser.  There are
different group of classes:
   1. implementing support for identifying matching alignments
   2. implementing the expression parser
   3. implementing the parser
   4. support

1. Implementing support for identifying matching alignments
-----------------------------------------------------------
BracketStack.java
   class to support the enforcement of alignment as delimiter in TLA+, e.g.
     /\
     /\
       /\
       /\
     /\
   we keep track of the kind of "bracket", e.g.  AND, OR, but
   identified from the type of STN. It is organized as a stack as
   operators are embedded in expressions.  Stacks are created,
   pushed or popped.  With the top reference, we can compare whether
   an operator will be aligned, to the right or the left.

StackElement.java
   An element in BracketStack

2. Implementing the expression parser
-------------------------------------
Expression parser:
   The "high level" parser simply pushed expression elements on a stack,
   on which well formed expressions are reduced, according to precedence
   + associativity rules.

OSelement.java
   Defines the objects that go on the operator stack: the operator and
   the syntax node.  An OSelement object can be viewed as an
   information cache, really.

Operator.java
   The Operator object associated with an operator defines the symbol
   and its properties--e.g.  "+" is infix.  An operator will also have
   low and high precedence levels, to direct the order in which
   expressions are evaluated.  e.g.  a*b+c is (a*b)+c

   Note that there is a lack of modularity between Operator and
   Operators.  An interface should be defined to define in one place
   constant values (nofix, infix, ...)  and string representations
   thereof.

OperatorStack.java
   This class name is a misnommer.  Or rather a short for Operator
   Expression Reduction Stack.  It is also really a stack of stacks.
   See comments in file.

   Operators are pushed onto the stack, and reduction operations called
   periodically.  As well as a final operation once we have captured
   all elements of the expression.

Operators.java
   Creates and manages all symbols defined in the grammar.  Initialized
   by Configuration.

3. implementing the parser
--------------------------
SyntaxTreeNode.java

The following are automatically generated from tla+.jj, the
implementation of the parser.
   ParseException.java
   SimpleCharStream.java
   TLAplusParser.java
   TLAplusParserConstants.java
   TLAplusParserTokenManager.java
   TokenMgrError.java 
   Token.java

The ParseException.java file produced by javacc must be modified for
use by the other parser files.  The modification consists of adding the
method getShortMessage(), whose current code is given at the end of
this file.  That method is called by code in TLAplusParser.java that is
obtained from the tla+.jj grammar file.

4. Support
----------
ParseError.java
   An exception.
ParseErrors.java
   An array of ParseError objects.


Note:
The current directory also contains ASCII_CharStream.java, which is
obsolete.  It was constructed by an earlier version of javacc, which
now constructs SimpleCharStream.java instead.

==================================================================
tlasany/st directory
-----------------------

st (short for Syntax Tree) creates an abstract view of the parse tree.
It was created for decoupling from other operations, but its use is
certainly not strictly necessary.

Only Location and SyntaxTreeNode are required.

Location.java
  A location specifies the position of a syntactic unit in the source
  - beginLine() start line of a syntactic unit
  - beginColumn() start line of a syntactic unit
  - endLine() start column of a syntactic unit
  - endColumn() end column of a syntactic unit
  - source() returns source file
  - toString() returns a pprintable version of content

SyntaxTreeConstants.java
   Interface defining all constants for SyntaxTreeNodes.  This extends
   the numbering of tokens, which is done by javacc and put in
   TLAplusParserConstants.java, to SyntaxTreeNode objects' `kind'
   field.  Both tokens and nodes are in the syntax tree.  This class
   also contains an array of strings which give a printable version of
   the tree node kinds.

The ParseError and ParseErrors interfaces in this directory (st) are
implemented by the classes of the same name in the parser/ directory.
These interfaces are also implemented by classes in modanalyzer/.
------
ParseError.java
  interface for a parse error
  prescribes
  - String reportedError()
  - String defaultError()

ParseErrors.java
  interface to an Array of Parse Errors.

==================================================================
tlasany/explorer directory
-----------------------
   This is an interface to the semantic Tree, for exploration, that is
   mainly to display the semantic tree.  It interacts with an inputStream
   for commands.  The operations are really straightforward: identifying
   a symbol and printing relevant information.

ExploreNode.java
  interface to retrieve information fron node
Explorer.java
  getLine 
  printNode
  lookUpAndPrintSyntaxTree( String)
  lookUpAndPrintDef( String)
  levelDataPrint( String )
  executeCommand()
  parseAndExecuteCommand()
  printSyntaxTree()
  main()

ExplorerQuitException.java
  Exception in case of Explorer problem.

==================================================================
tlasany/configuration directory
-------------------------------

ConfigConstants.java
   This file was originally generated by javacc for parsing
   defaultConfig, and then J-Ch added the definition of defaultConfig
   to it.

The following files were originally generated by javacc from a
grammar file that has vanished.  They parse the string
ConfigConstants.defaultConfig to build Operators.BuiltinTable.
--------------------
ASCII_CharStream.java
Configuration.java
ConfigurationTokenManager.java
ParseException.java
Token.java
TokenMgrError.java

==================================================================
tlasany/error directory
-----------------------

As noted below, this entire directory can be eliminated.

ErrorRegistry.java
   Doesn't appear to be used.

Log.java
   Used by BracketStack for no good purpose.  It can be removed and
   references to it eliminated.

LogCategories.java
   Used only by Log.java

Timing.java
   Appears to be unused.

ToolkitError.java
   Appears to be unused.
==================================================================
tlasany/modanalyzer directory
-----------------------------
The files in this directory are used as a interface between the driver
and the single-module parser.  It contains the mechanics to extract
which modules have been referenced, to map module names to files, and
to keep track of which modules have already been parsed.

ModuleContext.java

ModuleRelatives.java
NameToFileIStream.java
NamedInputStream.java
ParseUnit.java

   This class contains the methods by which a tool calls the Front End
   to parse input and to create a semantic tree, and for various other

   the set means that p must have a level <= x.
