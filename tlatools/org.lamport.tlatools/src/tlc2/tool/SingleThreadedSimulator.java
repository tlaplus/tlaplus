	 * continue with state-space exploration. Contrary, the SingleThreadedSimulator
	 * halts state-space exploration while it consumes the result of its worker.
	 * This translates into calling simulateAndReport directly as opposed to
	 * creating proper thread in Simulator. The need for SingleThreadedSimulator
	 * arose in the scope of the TLC debugger that must halt state-space
	 * exploration. Otherwise, concurrent workers mess up the stack in
	 * TLCDebugger#stack when a user e.g. debugs an Alias that is evaluated in
	 * printBehavior below. TODO: Simulator should be refactored to support the
	 * debugger use-case right away. However, I couldn't make this work for N
	 * workers without complex concurrency primitives such as a TransferQueue,
	 * Phaser, ...
