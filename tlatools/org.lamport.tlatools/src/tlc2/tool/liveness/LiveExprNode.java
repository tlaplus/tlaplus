/**
 * LNConj - a conjunction. (contains list of conjuncts) LNDisj - a disjunction.
 * (contains list of disjuncts) LNAll - Allways: []e LNEven - Eventually: <>e
 * LNNeg - Negation: -e LNState - State predicate. Concrete types: LNStateAST,
 * LNStateEnabled LNAction - Transition predicate. LNNext - next. ()e. Only used
 * for tableau construction. Not part of TLA
 *
 * LNState and LNAction have tags. When constructing the tableau, we will have
 * to check whether two primitives are equal to each other, to distinguish
 * atoms. We could do it just by checking the object pointers to the Act and
 * State ASTNodes. But to make it absolutely explicit, I will use integer tags.
 * These are initialized to distinct values immediately before tableau
 * construction, used during tableau construction, and not used any more.
 *
 * There's a little bit of a hierarchy for the LNState. That's because
 * LNStateAST (which has just an ASTNode for the state predicate) must be
 * evaluated differently from LNStateEnabled (which has ENABLED ast in it)
 *
 * We are going to end up evaluating LNState and LNAction when we come to
 * construct the tableau graph. That's for the EAs, the EAs, and for local
 * consistency. Therefore LNState and LNAction have appropriate eval functions.
