/**
 * An ExprNode is a node that represents some kind of expression
 * (i.e., not an operator argument).
 *
 * Exception as of 18 May 2008 modification made by LL. LabelNode
 * extends ExprNode, but it can represent a labeled ASSUME/PROVE as
 * well as a labeled expression.
 *
 * It is extended by AtNode, DecimalNode, LetInNode, NumeralNode,
 *                   OpApplNode, StringNode, SubstInNode
 *
 * It extends the ExprOrOpArgNode class.
 *
 * It contains the methods getLevel and getLevelParams that specify the
 * expression's level, where the level indicates the TLA level of the
 * expression as follows.
 *
 *   0 : Constant Level
 *   1 : State Level
 *   2 : Action Level
 *   3 : Temporal Level
 *
 * In general, the expression will be in the scope of some formal
 * parameters, so its level will depend on the level of the expressions
 * substituted for some of those parameters.  For example, if p and q
 * are formal parameters, and x is a declared variable, then the level
 * of the expression
 *
 *    ENABLED(p' = x) /\ q
 *
 * is the maximum of 1 (the level of the ENABLED expression) and the
 * level of q.  For the ExprNode n that represents this expression,
 * n.getLevel() equals 1 and n.getLevelParams() is the array of length 1
 * whose single element is (a ref to) the FormalParamNode for q.
 *
 * Now suppose that an expression e in a constant module contains a
 * declared constant c.  If the module is instantiated, then the level
 * of the instantiated version of e will depend on the level of the
 * expression substituted for c.  In that case, the array
 * getLevelParams() for the node representing e will contain a ref to
 * the OpDeclNode for the declaration of c.  Note that an instantiation
 * of a nonconstant module must substitute a constant expression for a
 * constant parameter, so in this case there's no need to put any refs
 * to constant declarations in the array getLevelParams().
 *
 * Implementation Note.  A module is a constant module iff the following
 * conditions are satisfied:
 *
 *   1. It contains no VARIABLE declarations (or other nonCONSTANT
 *      declarations in an ASSUME).
 *   2. It contains no nonconstant operators such as prime ('), ENABLED,
 *      or [].
 *   3. It extends and instantiates only constant modules.
 *
 * The Front End can thus easily determine during the parsing phase
 * whether or not a module is a constant module.  Thus, it can have that
 * information available when building the semantic tree.
