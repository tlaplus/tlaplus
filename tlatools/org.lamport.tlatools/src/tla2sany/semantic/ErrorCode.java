   * Many error checks are duplicates of earlier error checks, so the process

   * the checks function more as internal errors, assertions about the state

   * as the semantic checking code is very large and it is difficult to know
   * what has or has not yet been checked at any given point. However, it is
   * useful to tag these error checks with this error code as possible basis
   * for future action. Note that it also says *suspected* - it is certainly
   * possible that some parse input could evade all prior error checks and
   * make it to the error check in question, it just hasn't yet been found.
   * If a user manages to trigger an error with this error code, that counts
   * as a bug in the parser that should be reified with an actual error code.
   *
   * Arity checks are a very common class of errors tagged with this code:
   * the match between the arity of an operator and an application of it is
   * checked many times in the codebase, and almost all of these checks will
   * never be reached since the semantic checking process will have failed
   * before those points.
