/**
 * This test takes about four minutes with 32 cores on an EC2 cr1.8xlarge instance.
 * On a Thinkpad T430s it takes eight times as long and uses up 4GB of memory (see customBuild.xml).
 * 
 * The purpose of this test is to establish a thread contention baseline that TLC shows for
 * liveness checking (with and without tableaux). More precisely the time each TLC worker
 * thread spends in the WAITING and BLOCKED state must not exceed more than waitedRatio and
 * blockedRatio. The current values for waitedRatio and blockedRatio have been obtained empirically.
