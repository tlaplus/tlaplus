/**
 * TLC bug caused by TLC's not preserving the semantics of CHOOSE
 * 
 *  Leslie Lamport 2012-03-08 00:26:08 UTC
 *  
 *  Running TLC on the spec written by Tom 
 *  Rodeheffer that I will attach finds a deadlock (as it should) and then 
 *  produces the following error when trying to generate the error trace:
 *  
 *      Failed to recover the initial state from its fingerprint.
 *      This is probably a TLC bug(2).
 *    
 *  The problem occurs because the value that TLC computes for a CHOOSE 
 *  depends on TLC's internal representation of its argument.  To compute 
 *  the 2nd state of the trace, TLC sets the variables 'set' and 'fun' to S1
 *  and  Ch(S1), respectively, where Ch(S1) equals CHOOSE of an expression 
 *  containing S1.   Fingerprinting that state causes TLC to canonicalize 
 *  the representation of the value of 'set', changing its representation of
 *  the value of S1.  When TLC constructs the error trace, it must 
 *  re-execute the spec to get the states in the trace.  When it tries to 
 *  compute the 2nd state of the trace, it uses the canonicalized 
 *  representation of S1, causing it to compute a different value of 
 *  variable 'set' than it did the first time, so it doesn't find a state 
 *  with the correct fingerprint as the next state of the trace.  (Note that
 *  the error message is misleading, since it's not the intiial state that 
 *  TLC fails to recover.)
 *  
 *  There seem to be two possible fixes.  The first is to canonicalize the 
 *  argument of CHOOSE whenever it is evaluated.  The second is to create a 
 *  separate deep copy of the state before fingerprinting it.  The first 
 *  seems like the best solution, since I can't think of any practical case 
 *  in which this would cause performance problems.  However, I will consult
 *  with Yuan Yu before doing anything about this.
