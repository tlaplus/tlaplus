		// reason why printTrace(..) correctly generates the states is due to
		// the way the error trace gets generated. Starting from an init state,
		// it uses the predecessor and the successors fingerprint to generate
		// the successor state. For this model this means the error trace
		// contains the states <<(x=a, y=0), (x=a, y=1), (x=b, y=0)>>. The state
		// (x=b, y=0) is generated from its fingerprint f and its predecessor
		// state (x=a, y=1) AND the action N1. Since N1 mandates that x flips,
		// tool generates a state with x=b despite the declared symmetry.
