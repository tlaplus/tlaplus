(* The definitions of all the operators in this module are overridden by   *)
(* TLC with methods defined in the Java class tlc2.module.TLC.  Each       *)
(* definition is overridden with the method of the same name, except that  *)
(* the mapping from infix operators to Java methods is specified in the    *)
(* static block at the beginning of the Java class.                        *)

(* TLC can read and set a special list of values while evaluating          *)
(* expressions using the operators TLCSet and TLCGet.  When TLC evaluates  *)
(* TLCSet(i,v), for any positive integer i and arbitrary value v, it       *)
(* obtains the value TRUE and sets element number i of the list to v.      *)
(* When TLC evaluates TLCGet(i), the value it obtains is the current value *)
(* of the element number i of this list.                                   *)
(*                                                                         *)
(* One use of this feature is to check TLC's progress during long          *)
(* computations.  For example, suppose TLC is evaluating a formula         *)
(* \A x \in S : P where S is a large set, so it evaluates P many times.    *)
(* You can use TLCGet, TLCSet, and Print to print something after every    *)
(* 1000 times TLC evaluates P.                                             *)
(*                                                                         *)
(* As explained in the description of the TLCEval operator below, you may  *)
(* also want to use this feature to count how many times TLC is evaluating *)
(* an expression e.  To use value number i as the counter, just replace e  *)
(* by                                                                      *)
(*                                                                         *)
(*   IF TLCSet(i, TLCGet(i)+1) THEN e ELSE 42                              *)

(* TLCGet accepts some pre-defined string values to query TLC state. The   *)

(*   - TLCGet("distinct") evaluates to the total number of distinct states *)
(*     found by TLC so far, globally.                                      *)
(*   - TLCGet("queue") evaluates to the number of states currently in the  *)
(*     queue to be checked.                                                *)
(*   - TLCGet("duration") evaluates to the number of seconds elapsed since *)
(*     model checking began.                                               *)
(*   - TLCGet("diameter") evaluates to the length of the longest behavior  *)
(*     found by TLC so far, globally (equals one in the initial predicate).*)
(*   - TLCGet("level") is the length of the current behavior (equals zero  *)
(*     in the evaluation of the initial predicate).                        *)
(*                                                                         *)
(* For reasons of efficiency, TLCGet and TLCSet behave somewhat strangely  *)
(* when TLC is run with multiple worker threads.  Each worker thread       *)
(* maintains its own individual copy of the list of values on which it     *)
(* evaluates TLCGet and TLCSet.  The worker threads are activated only     *)
(* after the computation and invariance checking of the initial states.    *)
(* Before then, evaluating TLCSet(i,v) sets the element i of the list      *)
(* maintained by all threads.  Thus, the lists of all the worker threads   *)
(* can be initialized by putting the appropriate TLCSet expression in an   *)
(* ASSUME expression or in the initial predicate.                          *)

(* TLC evaluates RandomElement(S) to be a pseudo-randomly chosen element   *)

(* done to permit TLC to generate an error trace if an error is found.     *)

(* The constant value Any has the special property that, for any value v,  *)
(* TLC evaluates the expression  v \in Any  to equal TRUE.  The special    *)

(* TLC often uses lazy evaluation.  For example, it may not enumerate the  *)
(* elements of a set of the form {x \in T : P(x)} unless it has to; and it *)
(* doesn't have to if it only needs to check if an element e is in that    *)
(* set.  (TLC can do that by evaluating x \in T and P(e).) TLC uses        *)
(* heuristics to determine when it should completely evaluate an           *)
(* expression.  Those heuristics work well most of the time.  However,     *)
(* sometimes lazy evaluation can result in the expression ultimately being *)
(* evaluated multiple times instead of just once.  This can especially be  *)
(* a problem when evaluating a recursively defined operator.  You can get  *)
(* TLC to fully evaluate an expression exp and not use lazy evaluation by  *)
(* replacing exp with TLCEval(exp).                                        *)

(* If TLC is taking a long time to evaluate something, you can check if    *)
(* lazy evaluation is the source of the problem by using the TLCSet and    *)
(* TLCGet operators to count how many times expressions are being          *)
