Usage : java tlatex.TLA [options] [inputFile]

The inputFile is required except when the -help or -info option is
specified.  If inputFile does not contain an extension, the extension
"tla" is assumed.

Options:

   -help 
     Types this message.

   -info
     Types complete instructions for using TLATeX.

   -number
     Produces line numbers in the left margin.

   -shade
     Causes comments to be shaded in Postscript file.

   -noPcalShade
     When the -shade option is chosen, this option causes a
     PlusCal algorithm (which appear in a comment) not to
     be shaded.  (The algorithm's comments will be shaded.)
   
   -grayLevel num
     Determines darkness of comment shading, where 
     0 = black, 1 = white.  Default is .85.

   -ps
   -nops
     Create or do not create Postscript output.  Default
     is -ps if the -shade option specified, otherwise -nops.

   -psCommand cmd
     The command run to produce a Postscript or PDF or
     whatever file from LaTeX's dvi output.  Should be 
     used only if LaTeX is producing a pdf file.  
     Default is "dvips".

   -latexCommand cmd
     The command used to run LaTeX.  The default is "latex".
     
   -latexOutputExt ext
     The extension of the final output--e.g., dvi or pdf.
     Needed only if -metadir is specified, so the output
     will be copied to the directory from which tla2tex is
     called.

   -out file
     The root name of the main LaTeX input file and its output 
     files.  Default is the root name of inputFile.

   -alignOut file
     The root name of the LaTeX input file and output files used
     to compute alignment. Default is the -out file.

   -tlaOut file
     If specified, TLATeX writes a copy of inputFile, with 
     "`^ ... ^'" regions removed, to the specified file.  (The 
     extension "tla" is added if no extension is specified.)

   -noProlog
     Causes TLATeX to ignore all text before beginning of module.

   -noEpilog
     Causes TLATeX to ignore all text after end of module.

   -style file
     Causes TLATeX to use the specified LaTeX package instead of 
     adding its own style commands to the LaTeX files it produces.

   -tlaComment
     When determining if an ambiguous word in a comment is a symbol,
     with this option, TLATeX errs on the side of making it a symbol 
     TLATeX usually does better without this option.

   -ptSize num
     Specifies the point size of the font.  May be 10, 11, or 12.
     Default is 10.

   -textwidth  num
   -textheight num
     Specifies the \textwidth and \textheight values, in points, for 
     the LaTeX output.  (A point is 1/72 of an inch--about 1/3 mm.)

   -hoffset  num
   -voffset  num
     Specifies TeX's \hoffset and \voffset values, in points, for 
     the LaTeX output.  (Used to center output on the page.)
     
   -metadir directory
     Specifies the directory in which LaTeX files are written and
     from which LaTeX is run.  (Primarily for use by the toolbox.)
