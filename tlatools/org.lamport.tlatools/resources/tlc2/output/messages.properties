TLCDescription=\
The model checker (TLC) provides the functionalities of model checking\n\
or simulation of TLA+ specifications. It may be invoked from the command\n\
line, or via the model checking functionality of the Toolbox.\n\n\
By default, TLC starts in the model checking mode using breadth-first\n\
approach for the state space exploration.\n\n\
A pretty-printed and in-depth description of TLC can be found at:\n\n\

TraceExplorerDescription=\
TraceExplorer performs the parsing / consuming of the TLC model checking\n\
'tool mode' output. With this parsed output, it allows the user to do\n\
three actions, at this time:\n\
\to pretty print the error states in a fashion similar to what would\n\
\t    be seen in the Toolbox\n\
\to generate a SpecTE tla/cfg file pair which allows a user to then\n\
\t    work with their model so that it is at the error state\n\
\to evalute trace expressions at each error state; this action also\n\
\t    also generates the SpecTE tla/cfg pair if it hasn't already\n\
\t    been done\n\n\
TraceExplorer also allows the user to evaluate any single expression\n\
via the model checker.\n\n\
If a SpecName is not specified, it is expected that tool output will\n\
be arriving on stdin; in this case, any specification of -source will\n\
be ignored.
